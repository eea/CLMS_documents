  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical and practical foundations underpinning the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS). It details the processing steps involved in generating EGMS products, from basic SAR interferometry principles to the specifics of producing Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) InSAR datasets. The document elucidates the commonalities and differences among the four independent InSAR processing chains contributing to EGMS, highlighting the rigorous harmonisation efforts undertaken to ensure consistent and homogeneous results. Furthermore, it outlines the data update strategies employed to maintain the relevance and accuracy of EGMS products over time.",
