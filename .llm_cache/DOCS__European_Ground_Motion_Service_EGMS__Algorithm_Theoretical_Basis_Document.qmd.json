  "intro": "This document serves as the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) for the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). It outlines the scientific and technical underpinnings of EGMS product generation, spanning from Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry principles to the specifics of Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) product creation. The document details the multi-interferogram processing chains, the positioning satellite framework used for calibration, and key aspects of radar remote sensing relevant to ground motion monitoring. It also highlights the measures taken to ensure consistency and homogeneity across different processing chains involved in EGMS production.",
