  "intro": "This document presents calibration data for the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS), specifically focusing on measurements acquired from Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS). The data provides precise latitude, longitude, and ground motion velocity components (North, East, Up) along with their respective standard deviations. This information is crucial for validating and refining ground motion models derived from satellite-based radar interferometry (InSAR) techniques.",
