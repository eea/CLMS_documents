  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive description of the methodologies, algorithms, and workflows employed to generate the High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). These products offer detailed annual maps and change layers for Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands across Europe at 10-meter and 20-meter resolutions. The document details the underlying scientific rationale and technical implementation, covering aspects such as the Base Vegetation Layer (BVL), specific product generation algorithms, and post-processing steps, thereby enabling users to effectively apply these products in various environmental and agricultural monitoring applications.",
