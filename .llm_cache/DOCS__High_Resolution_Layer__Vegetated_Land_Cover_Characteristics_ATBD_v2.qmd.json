  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) comprehensively details the scientific methodologies and processing workflows employed to generate the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service's (CLMS) High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products. These products provide annual land cover maps and change layers focusing on Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands at 10-meter and 20-meter resolutions. The document describes the algorithms, input data (primarily Sentinel-2 imagery), and post-processing techniques used to produce various layers, including the Base Vegetation Layer (BVL), Dominant Leaf Type (DLT), Tree Cover Density (TCD), Herbaceous Cover (HER), Ploughing Indicator (PLOUGH), Crop Type (CTY), and Grassland Mowing Events (GRAME). It also addresses encountered issues, known limitations, and confidence layers associated with each product.",
