  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive description of the methodologies and algorithms used to generate the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products. These products offer detailed annual maps and change layers for Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands at 10-meter and 20-meter resolutions. The document details the processing workflows, from input data such as Sentinel-2 imagery to the generation of final product layers, including the Base Vegetation Layer (BVL), Tree Cover Density (TCD), Herbaceous Cover (HER), and Crop Type (CTY). It also addresses encountered issues, known limitations, and provides confidence layers to aid users in effective application of the products.",
