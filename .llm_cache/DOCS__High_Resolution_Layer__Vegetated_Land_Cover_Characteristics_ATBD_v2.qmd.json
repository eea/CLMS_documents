  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive description of the methodologies and algorithms used to generate the High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). The HRL VLCC product suite includes detailed annual maps and change layers for Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands at 10-meter and 20-meter resolutions, leveraging multi-source satellite data, particularly Sentinel-2 imagery. The document details the creation of the Base Vegetation Layer (BVL) and the specific algorithms for various land cover characteristics, covering topics such as temporal convolutional neural networks, spectral analysis, post-classification processing, and the generation of confidence layers. It serves as a key resource for understanding the scientific basis and technical implementation of these products.",
