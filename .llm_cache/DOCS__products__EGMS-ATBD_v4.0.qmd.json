  "intro": "This document serves as the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) for the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). It details the theoretical underpinnings and practical methodologies employed in the generation of EGMS products, encompassing the Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) InSAR datasets. From fundamental Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry principles to the intricacies of EGMS product generation, including calibration using a positioning satellite framework, this ATBD offers a comprehensive technical overview. It also highlights the consistency achieved across four independent InSAR processing chains and outlines the procedures for updating these products.",
