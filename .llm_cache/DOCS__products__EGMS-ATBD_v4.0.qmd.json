  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive description of the theoretical and practical underpinnings of the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) production. It covers the entire process, from fundamental Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometric principles to the specifics of generating EGMS products, including the Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) InSAR datasets. The document details the generic multi-interferogram processing chain, highlights the differences between generic processors and the specific processing chains used for EGMS, and explains the procedures for product generation and updates, while emphasizing the high level of consistency and homogeneity achieved across the independent InSAR processing chains.",
