  "intro": "This document provides a comprehensive description of the theoretical and practical underpinnings of the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) production. It begins with an overview of basic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometric theory and progresses to the specifics of generating EGMS products, including Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) InSAR products. The document details the positioning satellite framework used for calibration, compares generic multi-interferogram processing chains with those used for EGMS, and outlines the protocols for producing and updating the three EGMS products, ensuring high consistency and homogeneity across deliverables from four independent InSAR processing chains.",
