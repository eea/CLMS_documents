  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive overview of the scientific and technical principles underpinning the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). It details the theoretical foundations, algorithms, and processing chains employed in generating EGMS products, encompassing Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) InSAR datasets. The document elucidates the transition from fundamental SAR interferometry concepts to the specific implementation of the four independent processing chains that contribute to EGMS, emphasizing the measures taken to ensure consistency and homogeneity across the final deliverables, despite the diversity of algorithms used.",
