  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive overview of the scientific and technical foundations underpinning the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). It details the theoretical principles, algorithms, and processing chains used to generate EGMS products, encompassing Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) InSAR datasets. The document outlines the specifics of SAR interferometry, multi-interferogram processing, and the integration of a positioning satellite framework for product calibration, highlighting the harmonisation efforts across four independent InSAR processing chains to ensure consistency and homogeneity in the final deliverables.",
