  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive description of the theoretical and practical underpinnings for generating the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) products within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. It covers the fundamental principles of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry, the specifics of EGMS product generation including the Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) InSAR products, and the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) framework used for calibration. The document also details the distinct processing chains employed, focusing on their consistency, homogeneity, and the quality assurance measures implemented.",
