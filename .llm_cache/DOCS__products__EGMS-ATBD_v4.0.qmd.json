  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive overview of the scientific and technical foundations for the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) product generation within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). It details the theoretical principles, data processing methodologies, and specific algorithms employed in the production of EGMS products, encompassing Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) InSAR datasets. From the fundamentals of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry to the intricacies of multi-interferogram processing chains and GNSS calibration, this document serves as a reference for understanding the EGMS production pipeline and the underlying scientific rationale.",
