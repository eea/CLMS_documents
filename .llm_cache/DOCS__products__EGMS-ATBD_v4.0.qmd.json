  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) comprehensively describes the theoretical and practical foundations of the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) production within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). It ranges from fundamental Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometric principles to the specifics of generating EGMS Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) InSAR products. The document details the processing steps, encompassing data acquisition, image co-registration, interferogram generation, atmospheric correction, and geocoding. It also highlights differences and harmonisation efforts among the four independent InSAR processing chains contributing to EGMS, ensuring consistency and high quality across the deliverables.",
