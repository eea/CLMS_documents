  "intro": "This report summarises the findings of a public consultation survey regarding the Copernicus Land Data Store (CLDS), launched in October 2023. The survey aimed to understand working practices within geospatial applications, focusing on the factors that either hinder or encourage users to adopt cloud-based solutions. By assessing the balance between the need for cloud infrastructure (driven by data volume and processing requirements) and the concerns or difficulties associated with migration, the survey provides valuable insights into the requirements and challenges faced by data producers and consumers within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service ecosystem.",
