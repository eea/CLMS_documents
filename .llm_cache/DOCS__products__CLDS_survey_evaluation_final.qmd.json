  "intro": "This report presents the findings of a public consultation survey regarding the Copernicus Land Data Store (CLDS), aiming to understand the user requirements and challenges associated with geospatial data and cloud-based processing. The survey assesses the balance between the need for cloud-based solutions, driven by data volume and processing demands, and the concerns or difficulties that hinder migration to such environments. It explores user experiences with data access, processing, and the overall usability of cloud platforms, providing insights into how the CLDS can better serve the geospatial community by addressing key limitations and promoting wider adoption of cloud-based workflows.",
