  "intro": "This report presents a comprehensive analysis of the Copernicus Land Data Store (CLDS) consultation survey, conducted in October 2023, which aimed to understand the geospatial community's working practices and identify the key factors influencing cloud adoption. The survey investigated the balance between the necessity for cloud-based solutions, driven by data volumes and processing needs, and the concerns hindering migration, such as cost, complexity, and data accessibility. By examining user backgrounds, data handling habits, and perceived challenges, the report provides valuable insights into improving cloud services for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) user base.",
