  "intro": "This report presents the findings of a public consultation survey concerning the Copernicus Land Data Store (CLDS). The survey sought to understand the current geospatial application landscape, focusing on factors hindering or facilitating the adoption of cloud-based solutions. It explores the balance between the need for advanced data processing capabilities, the concerns surrounding cloud migration, and the potential role of curiosity in driving adoption. The survey examines user backgrounds, data handling practices, and experiences with cloud environments to inform the development and implementation of the CLDS.",
