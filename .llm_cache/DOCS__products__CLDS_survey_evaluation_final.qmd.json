  "intro": "This report presents the findings of a public consultation survey conducted to evaluate user needs and challenges related to cloud-based geospatial data processing, with a particular focus on the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). The survey investigated the factors influencing the adoption of cloud environments, weighing the perceived benefits against existing concerns and difficulties. It targeted geospatial professionals, including data producers and consumers, to understand their current practices, technical expertise, and the obstacles hindering their transition to cloud-based workflows. The results provide valuable insights for optimising the Copernicus Land Data Store (CLDS) and enhancing the accessibility and usability of CLMS data within cloud environments.",
