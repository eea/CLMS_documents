  "intro": "This report presents the findings of a public consultation survey regarding the Copernicus Land Data Store (CLDS), aimed at understanding the geospatial community's working practices and barriers to cloud adoption. The survey explored the balance between the need for cloud-based solutions due to data volumes and processing demands, versus the concerns and difficulties associated with migrating to the cloud. It assessed user backgrounds, data handling practices, and perceptions of cloud-based storage and processing solutions, ultimately informing the development of the CLDS and strategies to improve its usability and accessibility.",
