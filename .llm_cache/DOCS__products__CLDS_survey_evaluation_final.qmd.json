  "intro": "This report presents the findings of a public consultation survey regarding the Copernicus Land Data Store (CLDS), aimed at understanding user practices and challenges in geospatial applications, with a particular focus on cloud adoption. The survey assessed the balance between user needs for cloud-based solutions and the difficulties hindering migration, also considering the role of curiosity in driving adoption. The results, while based on a limited sample size, highlight key trends and specific concerns related to data accessibility, processing, and the overall user experience in cloud environments.",
