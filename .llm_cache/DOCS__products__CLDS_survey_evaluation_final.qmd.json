  "intro": "This report summarises the findings of a consultation survey regarding the Copernicus Land Data Store (CLDS), focusing on understanding user practices and barriers related to geospatial applications and cloud adoption. The survey aimed to assess the balance between the need for cloud-based solutions, driven by data volume and processing demands, and the concerns or difficulties hindering cloud migration. It explores the perspectives of data producers (commercial, public, and research) and data consumers, identifying key areas for improvement in cloud-based storage and processing solutions to enhance accessibility and usability of Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) data.",
