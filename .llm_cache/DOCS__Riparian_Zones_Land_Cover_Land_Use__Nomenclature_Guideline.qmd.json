  "intro": "This document serves as a comprehensive Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) nomenclature guideline specifically designed for the Copernicus Priority Area Monitoring product, Riparian Zones (RZ). Its purpose is to provide a detailed description of all LC/LU classes relevant to riparian environments, outlining their geographical characteristics, identifying suitable input datasets, and detailing appropriate methods for accurate class interpretation. This guide supports the consistent and very-high resolution delineation and characterisation of European riparian zones.",
