  "intro": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of the theoretical and practical underpinnings of the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS). It details the algorithms and methodologies used in the production of EGMS products, spanning from the fundamental principles of Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry to the specific processing chains employed for generating Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) InSAR products. The document further explores the models used for satellite positioning, essential for calibrating the L2b and L3 products, and outlines the approaches used for updating the datasets to ensure ongoing accuracy and relevance. Despite the involvement of multiple independent InSAR processing chains, the document highlights the careful tuning and cross-checking procedures implemented to ensure consistency and homogeneity across all EGMS deliverables.",
