  "intro": "This document serves as a comprehensive mapping guide for service providers involved in the Copernicus Urban Atlas project, specifically for the 2012 and 2018 reference years. It details the methodology for generating standardised land use and land cover (LU/LC) maps, including additional information layers such as the Street Tree Layer (STL) and Digital Height Model (DHM). The guide aims to ensure congruent product attributes, common nomenclature, consistent product appearance, and comparable product quality across Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) within the EU, EFTA, Western Balkans, the UK, and Turkey.",
