  "intro": "This document provides the GNSS (Global Navigation Satellite System) calibration data used within the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS), a component of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. The data consists of latitude, longitude, and displacement measurements (North, East, Up) along with their associated standard deviations. It aims to support users in validating and calibrating their own ground motion analyses and models against independent GNSS measurements.",
