  "intro": "This document provides Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) calibration data pertinent to the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS). The dataset comprises information related to Earth surface deformation measurements, specifically displacement values and their associated uncertainties, serving as a reference for validating and refining ground motion products derived from satellite-based InSAR techniques. The document is inherently technical, focused on the provision of data that supports the calibration of ground motion estimates.",
