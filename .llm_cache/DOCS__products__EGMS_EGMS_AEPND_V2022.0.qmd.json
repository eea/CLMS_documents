  "intro": "This document presents Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) calibration data for the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). The data, provided in a tabular format, consists of latitude, longitude, and vertical/horizontal ground motion measurements (North, East, Up) along with their associated standard deviations. The technical focus of the document lies in providing precise georeferenced information crucial for calibrating and validating ground motion products derived from satellite-based interferometric techniques.",
