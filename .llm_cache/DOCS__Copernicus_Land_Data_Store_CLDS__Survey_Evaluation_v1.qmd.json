  "intro": "This report presents the findings of a public consultation survey conducted to evaluate the Copernicus Land Data Store (CLDS) concept. The survey explored user practices in geospatial applications, focusing on the factors influencing the adoption of cloud-based environments. It examined the balance between the perceived need for cloud solutions, driven by data volume and processing requirements, and the challenges and concerns hindering cloud migration. The analysis also considers the role of user curiosity in shaping technology adoption, ultimately aiming to inform the development of CLDS and enhance the accessibility and usability of Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) data.",
