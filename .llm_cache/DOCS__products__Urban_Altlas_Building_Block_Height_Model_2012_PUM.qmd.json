  "intro": "This Product User Manual (PUM) serves as a comprehensive guide to the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service's (CLMS) Urban Atlas Building Block Height Model (UA BBHM) for the reference year 2012. It details the product's purpose, which is to provide very high-resolution building height information for 870 cities and urban centres within the EEA38 region, thus enabling improved urban density measurements and various analytical applications. The manual covers the dataset's characteristics, the methodology employed in its creation, potential use cases, and quality assessment procedures, all of which are essential for users seeking to leverage this harmonised building height data for urban analysis and policy support.",
