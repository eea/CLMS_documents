  "intro": "This document serves as a comprehensive nomenclature guideline for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service's Riparian Zones product, providing a detailed land cover and land use (LC/LU) classification system. It delineates the specific characteristics of each LC/LU class, including their geographic context, source datasets, and methodologies employed for their interpretation. The guideline aims to ensure consistent and accurate mapping of riparian areas across the EEA-38 countries and the UK, supporting the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) initiative.",
