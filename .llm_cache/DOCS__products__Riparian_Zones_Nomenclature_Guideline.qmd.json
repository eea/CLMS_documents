  "intro": "This document serves as a comprehensive nomenclature guideline for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service's Riparian Zones (RZ) product, a key component of the Priority Area Monitoring programme. It provides detailed descriptions of all Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) classes within riparian areas, outlining their geographic characteristics, specifying relevant input datasets, and describing appropriate methods for interpreting these classes. This guideline aims to ensure consistent and accurate mapping of riparian zones across the EEA-38 + UK, supporting environmental monitoring and policy implementation.",
