  "intro": "This document serves as a comprehensive nomenclature guideline for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) Coastal Zones product, providing detailed descriptions of Level 5 land cover/land use classes. It specifies the geographic characteristics, input datasets, and interpretation methods relevant to each class, aiming to ensure consistency and accuracy in the mapping of coastal areas across the EEA39 countries. By harmonising with established European land cover products and the MAES ecosystem typology, this guideline supports the creation of a detailed and comparable dataset for monitoring coastal zone environments.",
