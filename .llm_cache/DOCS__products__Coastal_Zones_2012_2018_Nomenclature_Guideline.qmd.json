  "intro": "This document serves as a comprehensive nomenclature guideline for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service's Coastal Zones land cover and land use (LC/LU) product. It provides detailed descriptions of all level 5 classes within the nomenclature, including their geographic characteristics, applicable input datasets, and relevant methods for accurate interpretation. The guideline ensures consistency in mapping and monitoring coastal environments across the EEA39 countries by standardising the classification of land cover and land use features specific to coastal zones.",
