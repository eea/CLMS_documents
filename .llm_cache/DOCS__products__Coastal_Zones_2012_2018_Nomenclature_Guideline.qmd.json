  "intro": "This document serves as a comprehensive guideline for the Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) nomenclature employed within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service's Coastal Zones product. It provides detailed descriptions of all Level 5 classes used in the Coastal Zones mapping, including their geographical characteristics, input datasets, and the methods used to interpret these classes from Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery. The nomenclature is designed to align with the MAES ecosystem typology and ensure compatibility with other European LC/LU products, facilitating the characterisation of coastal evolution over time.",
