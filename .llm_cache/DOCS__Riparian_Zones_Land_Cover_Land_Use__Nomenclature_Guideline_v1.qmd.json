  "intro": "This document serves as a comprehensive nomenclature guideline for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service's Riparian Zones (RZ) product, focusing on land cover and land use (LC/LU) classification. It provides detailed descriptions of all LC/LU classes within riparian areas, outlining their geographical characteristics, relevant input datasets, and appropriate interpretation methods. The guideline aims to ensure consistent and accurate mapping of riparian zones across the EEA-38 + UK, supporting the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES) initiative and the EU Biodiversity Strategy.",
