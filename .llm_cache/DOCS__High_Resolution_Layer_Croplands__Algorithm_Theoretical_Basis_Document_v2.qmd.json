  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive overview of the methodologies and algorithms used to generate the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service's (CLMS) High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products. The HRL VLCC suite offers detailed annual maps and change layers for Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands across Europe, utilising multi-source satellite data, particularly Sentinel-2 imagery. The document outlines the processing workflows, including the Base Vegetation Layer (BVL), annual classifications, post-classification processing, and the derivation of thematic products such as Dominant Leaf Type (DLT), Tree Cover Density (TCD), Herbaceous Cover (HER), and Crop Type (CTY). It details the algorithms, input data, confidence layers, and encountered issues, serving as a resource for understanding the scientific basis of these products and their application in environmental monitoring and policy support.",
