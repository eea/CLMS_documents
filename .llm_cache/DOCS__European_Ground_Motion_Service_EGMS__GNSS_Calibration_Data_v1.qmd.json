  "intro": "This document presents calibration data for the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS), a component of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). The data provides Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) measurements, including latitude, longitude, and displacement in North, East, and Up directions, along with associated uncertainties. This information is crucial for validating and improving the accuracy of ground motion products derived from satellite-based radar interferometry.",
