  "intro": "This document provides a comprehensive overview of the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) products, which are crucial for understanding ground displacement phenomena across Europe. It details the specifications, formats, attribute tables, and metadata associated with the EGMS Basic, Calibrated, and Ortho products. Furthermore, it includes essential information for users on accessing and utilising these products, along with descriptions of the ancillary datasets used in EGMS production, thus serving as a vital resource for both novice and expert users of InSAR data.",
