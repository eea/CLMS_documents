  "intro": "This document serves as a comprehensive Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) nomenclature guideline for the Copernicus Priority Area Monitoring product, Riparian Zones (RZ). It provides detailed descriptions of all LC/LU classes within the riparian zone context, including their geographic characteristics, the input datasets used for their interpretation, and the relevant methods employed in classifying each class. This guideline aims to ensure consistent and accurate mapping of riparian zones across the EEA-38 + UK, supporting environmental monitoring and assessment efforts.",
