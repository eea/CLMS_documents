  "intro": "This document serves as a Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) nomenclature guideline for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service\u2019s Riparian Zones (RZ) product, a high-resolution dataset characterising areas alongside rivers within the EEA-38 + UK. It offers detailed descriptions of LC/LU classes, outlining their geographical characteristics, input datasets, and methods for interpreting these classes. The document reflects revisions made to harmonise products and simplify classes, culminating in a nomenclature comprising 55 distinct categories structured into four levels aligned with the MAES typology of ecosystems.",
