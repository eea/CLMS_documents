It aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of the product by offering detailed descriptions of all LC/LU classes, including their geographical characteristics, relevant input datasets, and methods for interpreting these classes. The nomenclature detailed within is essential for ensuring consistent and accurate mapping of riparian areas across the EEA-38 + UK region using very-high resolution satellite imagery.",
