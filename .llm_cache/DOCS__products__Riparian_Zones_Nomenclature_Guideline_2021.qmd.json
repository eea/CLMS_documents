  "intro": "This document serves as a comprehensive nomenclature guideline for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service's Riparian Zones (RZ) product, focusing on Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) classification. It provides detailed descriptions of all LC/LU classes within riparian areas, outlining their geographical characteristics, relevant input datasets (primarily very-high resolution satellite imagery), and appropriate methodologies for accurate interpretation. The guideline is designed to ensure consistent and harmonised mapping of riparian zones across the EEA-38 + UK region, supporting environmental monitoring and assessment activities.",
