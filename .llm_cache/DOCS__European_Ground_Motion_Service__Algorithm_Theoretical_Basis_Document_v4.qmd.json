  "intro": "This document serves as the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) for the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS), a core component of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). It details the theoretical and practical underpinnings of EGMS product generation, spanning from fundamental Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry principles to the specific processing chains used to create Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) InSAR products. The document elucidates the algorithms employed, highlights the distinctions among the four independent InSAR processing chains utilised in EGMS, and explains the methodology for product updates, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the service's technical foundation.",
