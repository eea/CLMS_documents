  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive overview of the scientific and technical foundations underpinning the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS) within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). It details the theoretical principles, data processing algorithms, and practical implementation aspects involved in generating EGMS products, ranging from Basic (L2a) to Calibrated (L2b) and Ortho (L3) InSAR datasets. The document elaborates on SAR interferometry fundamentals, multi-interferogram processing chains, and the specific adaptations employed by the four independent InSAR Processing Entities (IPEs) contributing to EGMS. It includes considerations for wide-area processing, GNSS integration, and product updates, ensuring consistency and homogeneity across the service.",
