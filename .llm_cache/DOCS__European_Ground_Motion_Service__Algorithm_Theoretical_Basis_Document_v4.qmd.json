  "intro": "This document serves as the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document for the European Ground Motion Service (EGMS), a core component of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service. It details the scientific and technical underpinnings of EGMS product generation, encompassing the entire process from basic Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) interferometry principles to the specifics of generating Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b), and Ortho (L3) InSAR products. The document outlines the theoretical framework, processing chains, and calibration methodologies employed, while also highlighting the consistency and homogeneity achieved through careful tuning and cross-check procedures across the independent InSAR processing chains contributing to EGMS deliverables.",
