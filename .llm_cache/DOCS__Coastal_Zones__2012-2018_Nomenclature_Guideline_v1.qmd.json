It provides a detailed description of all level 5 classes, their geographic characteristics, available input datasets, and relevant methods for interpreting these classes, specifically for areas along the marine coastline of the EEA39 countries. The guideline ensures harmonisation and compatibility with other European land monitoring products while reflecting the particularities of coastal environments, supporting the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020 and addressing the MAES ecosystem typology.",
