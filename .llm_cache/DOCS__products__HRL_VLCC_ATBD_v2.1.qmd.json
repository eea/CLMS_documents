  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a detailed explanation of the methodologies and algorithms employed in the generation of the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service's (CLMS) High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products. It outlines the scientific rationale and technical implementation for mapping and monitoring tree cover, forests, grasslands, and croplands across Europe, including novel capabilities for crop type identification and agricultural practice detection. The document encompasses descriptions of input data, processing workflows, and post-classification refinements used to ensure the accuracy and consistency of the HRL VLCC product suite.",
