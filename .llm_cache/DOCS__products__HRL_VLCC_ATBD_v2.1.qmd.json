  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive scientific and technical foundation for the High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). It details the methodologies, algorithms, and workflows employed to generate annual status and change layers for Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands across Europe, leveraging multi-source satellite data, particularly Sentinel-2 imagery. The document encompasses the creation of the Base Vegetation Layer (BVL), the derivation of various land cover characteristics, and the generation of associated confidence layers, serving as an essential resource for understanding and effectively utilising these products in diverse applications such as environmental monitoring, agricultural management, and policy implementation.",
