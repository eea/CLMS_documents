  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive description of the methodologies and algorithms employed to generate the High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). These products offer detailed annual maps and change layers for Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands across Europe, utilising Sentinel-2 imagery and advanced processing techniques. The document details the scientific underpinnings of the HRL VLCC products, enabling their effective application in environmental monitoring, agricultural management, and policy compliance.",
