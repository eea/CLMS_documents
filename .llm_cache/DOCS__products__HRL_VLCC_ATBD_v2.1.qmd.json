  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive description of the algorithms and methodologies used to generate the High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). It details the processing chains for creating annual status and change layers for Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands at 10-meter and 20-meter resolutions, respectively. The document outlines the input data, classification techniques, post-processing steps, and confidence layers associated with each product, serving as a key resource for understanding the scientific foundation of the HRL VLCC suite and their applications in environmental monitoring and policy implementation.",
