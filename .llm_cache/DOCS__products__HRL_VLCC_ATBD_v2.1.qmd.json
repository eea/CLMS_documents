  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a comprehensive description of the methodologies and algorithms employed to generate the High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). These products offer detailed annual maps and change layers for key land cover types including Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands across Europe, using multi-source satellite data, primarily Sentinel-2 imagery. The document outlines the processing workflows, input data, and post-processing techniques used to produce various HRL VLCC layers, including Base Vegetation Layer (BVL), Dominant Leaf Type (DLT), Tree Cover Density (TCD), Herbaceous Cover (HER), Ploughing Indicator (PLOUGH), and Crop Type (CTY) and associated confidence layers.",
