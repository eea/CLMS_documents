  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) provides a detailed description of the methodologies and algorithms used to generate the High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products within the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS). It encompasses the scientific rationale, data processing steps, and post-classification procedures applied to create annual maps and change layers for Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands. The document outlines the technical specifications of the Base Vegetation Layer (BVL), tree cover density (TCD), dominant leaf type (DLT), herbaceous cover (HER), ploughing indicator (PLOUGH), grassland mowing events (GRAME), crop types (CTY), and cropping patterns (CP), as well as associated confidence layers. The focus is on the use of Sentinel-2 imagery, Sentinel-1 radar data, and ancillary datasets within advanced machine learning workflows, including temporal convolutional neural networks and transformer-based models, to produce high-quality, consistent land cover information for environmental monitoring and policy support.",
