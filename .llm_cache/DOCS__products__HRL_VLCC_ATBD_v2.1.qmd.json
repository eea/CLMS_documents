  "intro": "This document provides the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service's (CLMS) High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products. It details the methodologies, algorithms, and workflows used to generate annual maps and change layers for Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands at 10-meter (status layers) and 20-meter (change layers) resolution. The document outlines the scientific basis for these products, focusing on key algorithms such as the Base Vegetation Layer (BVL), Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks, and change detection methods, while also addressing encountered issues and known limitations.",
