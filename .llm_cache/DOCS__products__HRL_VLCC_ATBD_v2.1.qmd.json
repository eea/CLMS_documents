  "intro": "This Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD) comprehensively details the methodologies, algorithms, and workflows used to generate the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) High-Resolution Vegetated Land Cover Characteristics (HRL VLCC) products. It outlines the processing chains for deriving annual status and 3-yearly change layers related to Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands at 10-meter and 20-meter resolutions, respectively. The document focuses on the scientific underpinnings of the HRL VLCC products, covering aspects such as the Base Vegetation Layer (BVL), annual classification processes using Temporal Convolutional Neural Networks (TempCNN), post-classification processing, and the derivation of specific products like Dominant Leaf Type (DLT), Tree Cover Density (TCD), Herbaceous Cover (HER), Ploughing Indicator (PLOUGH), and Cropping Patterns (CP).",
