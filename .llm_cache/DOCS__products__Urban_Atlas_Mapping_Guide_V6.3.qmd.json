  "intro": "This document serves as a comprehensive technical manual for service providers involved in the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) Urban Atlas project. It provides detailed mapping guidance, product descriptions, and nomenclature to ensure the consistent and comparable generation of high-resolution land use and land cover (LU/LC) data for Functional Urban Areas (FUAs). The manual specifically addresses the Urban Atlas updates for the 2012 and 2018 reference years, building upon the initial 2006 mapping exercise and incorporating additional layers like the Street Tree Layer (STL) and Digital Height Model (DHM).",
