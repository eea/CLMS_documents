  "intro": "This document serves as the Product User Manual (PUM) for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) Urban Atlas, providing a technical guide for service providers involved in generating standardised land use and land cover (LU/LC) maps. It encompasses the mapping specifications, nomenclature, and quality control procedures essential for producing consistent and comparable Urban Atlas data for the 2006, 2012, and 2018 reference years, covering Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) across Europe and neighbouring countries. The manual also details the production of additional information layers such as the Street Tree Layer (STL) and Digital Height Model (DHM).",
