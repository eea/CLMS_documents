  "intro": "This Product User Manual (PUM) serves as a comprehensive guide for service providers involved in the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) Urban Atlas project. It specifies the methodology for generating standardised land use and land cover (LU/LC) maps, focusing on the update and extension of the Urban Atlas for the 2012 and 2018 reference years. The manual details the processes for mapping, change detection, and quality assurance across nearly 800 Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) in Europe, covering not only LU/LC but also additional information layers such as the Street Tree Layer (STL) and Digital Height Model (DHM).",
