  "intro": "This Product User Manual provides a comprehensive guide for service providers involved in generating land use and land cover (LU/LC) maps within the Copernicus Urban Atlas programme. It details the mapping specifications, nomenclature, and quality control procedures required to produce standardised and comparable datasets. Focusing on the 2012 and 2018 reference years, the manual outlines the methodology for mapping Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) across Europe, encompassing the use of Earth Observation data, ancillary information layers like the Street Tree Layer and Digital Height Model, and change detection techniques.",
