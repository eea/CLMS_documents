  "intro": "This report presents the findings of a public consultation survey conducted to evaluate user needs and challenges related to the Copernicus Land Data Store (CLDS). The survey aimed to understand factors influencing the adoption of cloud-based geospatial applications, focusing on the balance between the necessity for cloud solutions due to data volume and processing demands, and the concerns or difficulties that hinder cloud migration. The analysis encompasses user backgrounds, data handling practices, experiences with cloud environments, and specific requirements for data accessibility, processing, and service competitiveness, ultimately providing recommendations for improving the CLDS and related services.",
