  "intro": "This report presents the findings of a public consultation survey regarding the Copernicus Land Data Store (CLDS), which sought to understand the geospatial community's working practices and barriers to cloud adoption. The survey explored the balance between users' needs for cloud-based infrastructure and their concerns about migrating to such environments. By analysing responses from data producers, consumers, and researchers, the report identifies key factors influencing cloud adoption decisions and provides recommendations for improving the accessibility, usability, and competitiveness of cloud-based geospatial data services.",
