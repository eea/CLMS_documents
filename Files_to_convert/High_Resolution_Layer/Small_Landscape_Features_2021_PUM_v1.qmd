# Non-technical summary

The Copernicus High-Resolution Layer Small Landscape Features 2021 is a product developed to map and monitor small woody features across Europe and it is part of the European Union’s Earth observation program. This product uses satellite data to map small woody features and detect changes between 2018 and 2021. It plays a critical role in environmental monitoring, policymaking, and landscape management. Product key Features:

-   Woody Vegetation Layer: A map providing information about the presence or absence of trees of any type across Europe. Contrary to the Woody Vegetation Mask that was part of HRL SWF 2018 product suite, this product is not masked nor have geometric rules applied. This helps users understand the distribution of these features across different regions and provide a “all tree layer” that user can use to derive their own application.

-   Small Woody Features: Derived from Woody Vegetation Layer, this dataset identifies small woody features based on their morphological specifications. This helps in understanding woody vegetation outside of forested areas or plantation areas and its environmental impacts.

-   Street Tree Layer: Derived from Woody Vegetation Layer and CLMS Urban Atlas 2021, this dataset categorizes woody vegetation within urban areas across Europe.

-   Change Detection: A map that shows where small woody features have increased or decreased between 2018 and 2021. This helps identify landscape changes, including habitat loss or restoration.

Why is this product important? It provides detailed data for environmental research, landscape management, and policymaking. It is especially useful for monitoring biodiversity and climate change impacts. This product also supports reports required by international organizations, including the United Nations and the European Union. It helps governments and organizations make informed decisions to protect ecosystems.

Who can use it? This information is available to a wide range of users, including environmental agencies, scientists, policymakers, and conservationists. The data is openly accessible and can be used for research, policy reporting, and practical landscape management tasks, like planning conservation efforts or protecting small woody features from degradation.

# Executive summary

The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) provides geographical information on land cover and its changes, land use, vegetation state, water cycle and earth surface energy variables to a broad range of users in Europe and across the world for various domains and applications. CLMS is jointly implemented by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the European Commission’s Directorate-General Joint Research Centre (JRC).

This Product User Manual (PUM) aims to guide users with the usage of the High-Resolution Layer Small Landscape Features (SLF) for the 2021 reference year and captures detailed definitions and product specifications. The SLF portfolio currently comprises raster and vector layers dedicated to woody vegetation mapping, including forested areas, trees outside forest and urban trees. This 2021 release of HRL SLF covers the area of 38 EEA members and cooperating countries and UK at spatial resolutions of 5m and 100 m. It is compliant with the established specifications of the existing time series of the product, previously known as Small Woody Features (SWF). The product and its contained layers have been updated following the regular three-year cycle and additionally contain new Woody Vegetation Layer, Street Tree Layer (previously part of the CLMS Urban Atlas product) and the change layer between 2018 and 2021.

All layers contained here are derived from automatic image processing methods of Very High Resolution Earth Observation Imagery and high-resolution optical satellite image time series (Sentinel-2). They provide dedicated information on woody vegetation during the reference year 2021 (i.e. status) and detected dynamics between 2018 and 2021 (i.e. change). The aim of these layers is to provide reliable status and frequent updates on these land cover characteristics to facilitate environmental monitoring applications, regional and transnational analyses and, generally, to support decision-making that is based on spatial evidence.

# Lineage of product

## Initial release in 2015

The Copernicus High-Resolution Layer Small Woody Features was first introduced in 2015 as part of the European Union’s Earth observation program. This initial release provided pan-European information on linear structures such as hedgerows and patches of woody features outside of forested areas, excluding also agricultural tree plantations such as orchards or vineyards. The data were available in both vector format and raster files with a spatial resolution of 5 meters and aggregated 100 meters.

To ensure continuity between mapped features (linear or patchy features) and reflects ground reality, an additional class (additional woody features: AWF) was added to include in the product elements that were measured as out of the technical specifications (e.g.: too wide) but which connected valid linear or patchy features together.

This product aimed to enhance the understanding of landscapes, support biodiversity assessments, and inform sustainable land management practices.

## Product update 2018

In 2018, the Copernicus High-Resolution Layer Small Woody Features was updated to include more refined data and improved detection capabilities. The 2018 version continued to provide detailed information on small woody features, including linear and patchy elements, but did not differentiate further into specific types like linear, patchy or additional woody features.

The update leveraged advancements in data processing techniques and Very High Resolution (VHR) satellite imagery to offer more accurate and comprehensive datasets.

This update included new layers:

-   Woody Vegetation Mask (WVM) which aimed at mapping woody vegetation outside of forested areas without any geometrical rules applied,

-   Forest mask which aimed at ensuring better understanding of the SWF products (i.e. area considered as forest and therefore excluded from the SWF products),

-   Change Layer 2015-2018 at 100m spatial resolution, mapping increase or decrease of SWF.

## Product update 2021

The 2021 update of Copernicus High-Resolution Layer Small Landscape Features builds on lessons learned from previous production while taking advantage of latest development in Earth Observation processing technology to improve accuracy of the product. The data processing still relies on VHR data but also implement time-series of Sentinel-2, using Super Resolution algorithms.

The product suite ensure continuity with previous production by including existing SWF layers, but also includes new products:

-   Woody Vegetation Layer, which replaces the previous Woody Vegetation Mask. This layer aims at mapping, at 5m resolution, woody vegetation without any differentiation of height, size or nature without masking forested areas.

-   Street Tree Layer (STL): previously part of the Urban Atlas suite, this layer aims at mapping woody vegetation within artificial areas of Urban Atlas Functional Urban Areas (FUA)

-   Crop Mask: Derived from HRL NVLCC, this layer provides information about crops location and areas where geometrical rules are applied differently to derive valid SWF.

# User requirements

Small woody landscape features are important vectors of biodiversity and provide information on the fragmentation and connectivity of habitats, especially considering the importance of Green Infrastructure and hazard protection. Moreover, the HRL Small Woody Features contributes to monitor and evaluate the United Nations (UN) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). It can specifically support the Ecosystem assessment and land accounting in the context of SDG 15 “Life on Land”.

In the frame of the Horizon 2020 (H2020) project EcoLaSS, a survey[^1] of key stakeholders has been performed in order to evaluate the user requirements towards the evolution of existing and future Copernicus products. This survey also made use of the results from the Nextspace User Study[^2] and revealed that High Resolution Layers (HRL) users (such as European institutions, service industry, research and academia, national agencies, regional administrations, NGOs or private users) would in general appreciate:

[^2]: [Nextspace User Study: Nextspace database for user requirements](2%20Nextspace%20User%20Study:%20Nextspace%20database%20for%20user%20requirements)

-   High accuracy of the products

-   No data gaps - due to enhanced cloud gap mitigation

-   Extensive coverage of the product

-   Sufficient spatial and timely resolution concerning both, status layer and change layer

-   Short update cycles

-   Change monitoring

-   Free and open access

-   High technical quality

-   High thematic quality/meaningful and application-oriented product definitions

-   Standardised and comparable nomenclature

-   Transparent and scientific workflows and state-of-the-art methodology

-   Detailed documentation of these workflows and the respective methodology

-   Consistency of the pan-European products enabling synergistic use of all products

-   Streamlining the pan-European product with global ones

-   Availability of historic data and compatibility of time series

-   Open access to the original Copernicus Sentinel data

-   Sophisticated product presentation and visualisation possibilities in an online viewer on the Copernicus platform

-   IPCC conformity

It is the strength of the HRL products that many of the mentioned requirements are already satisfied or at least considered in current or upcoming implementations.

Frequently updated reliable data about forests and woodlands in general, and specifically linear and patchy woody elements in Europe is crucial to many key Copernicus users and stakeholders. A wall-towall detailed mapping of small woody features across EEA38 + UK already serves several purposes, such as a meaningful spatial location of a pan-European green corridor ecological network connecting natural and semi-natural habitats, reservoir of biodiversity, and preserving protected areas. It also reflects the regional variety and identity of old Europe’s rural and agricultural landscapes and its modern transformation, along with the increase of urbanisation and artificial surfaces. Even though SWF usually represents stable landscape markers across time, the Small Woody Features Change product 2018-2021 at 100m spatial resolution is an indicator of the European territory’s profound mutation in recent years. However, key Copernicus users and stakeholders would appreciate a more precise delineation of these changes which are currently difficult to capture mainly due, to difference of methodological approach between SWF 2018 and SWF 2021 and to EO data current limitations (e.g., still insufficient VHR spatial resolution ≤ 2 m, geographical misregistration between 2 monitoring cycles, etc.). Ultimately, the interlocking between SWF and HRL VLCC Forest Tree Cover Density (TCD) product, and in general with other HRL products, still needs improvement, as SWF somehow fills the gaps of the VLCC products while the coarser spatial 10m resolution of the latter can mask out significant SWF.

# Product application areas and use case examples

Compared to the other HRLs, the HRL SLF is a relatively new product. However, few use case have already been documented.

## Use case: Carbon storage assessment in agroforestry systems

In 2021, a multi-disciplinary team working in fields (such as landscape ecology and planning, agricultural landscape research, agronomy, organic farming and environmental science), led an interesting piece of research work on the role of small woody landscape features and agroforestry systems for national carbon budgeting in Germany (Golicz et al., 2021). This showed that the intensification of food production systems has resulted in landscape simplification, with trees and hedges disappearing from agricultural land, principally in industrialised countries. In recent years, the potential of agroforestry systems and small woody landscape features to sequester carbon was highlighted as one of the strategies to combat global climate change. The Federal Republic of Germany was one of the first countries to develop a long-term action plan for a low carbon economy and is considered a pioneer in this transition. Limited information exists on the carbon storage potential of emerging land use system such as agroforestry. The SWF 2015 dataset was used in conjunction with CLC 2012 in order to define several agricultural system types. Overall, this study showed that the implementation of agroforestry is promising for reducing agricultural Green House Gas emissions.

## Use case: CAP Indicator for preservation of biodiversity and farmed landscape features

The Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) comprises 9 key objectives for the period 2021-2027, among which the preservation of biodiversity and farmed landscapes as explained in Brief no 6[^3]. The disappearing of landscape features and semi-natural vegetation in agricultural land over the past decades, being a pressure on biodiversity and the environment has become a concern. Landscape features play an important role as a support to biodiversity and ecosystem services (e.g., habitat provision, mitigation of soil erosion, improvement of soil fertility), and also have aesthetic and cultural values attached. Thus, the importance to develop a stable and consistent indicator based on a sustainable and reproducible data

[^3]: <https://ec.europa.eu/info/sites/default/files/food-farming-fisheries/key_policies/documents/cap-specific-objectives-brief-6-biodiversity_en.pdf>

source for monitoring changes and to track changes of landscape features in European agricultural landscapes. The CAP Indicator I.21 aims to assess the area covered by landscape features in the agricultural land. The Copernicus Small Woody Features products are proposed as one of the information sources for the creation of the CAP I.21 indicator on landscape features. The agricultural area is derived with the help of Corine Land Cover (CLC) data which is spatially refined with Copernicus High Resolution Layers (HRL).

All layers are distributed in tiles corresponding to 100km LAEA grid cells.

## Product characteristics

### Woody Vegetation Layer

Woody Vegetation Layer is a newly introduced layer that contains information about woody vegetation without height, size, or shape differentiation. Objective of this layer is to provide an “all trees” layer (with the exception of vineyards) which allows the user to flexibly apply their own rules to derive any type of features they specifically require for their topic of interest. The layer is available as a raster layer at 5m spatial resolution.

### Small Woody Features Layer

Derived from WVL, Small Woody Features layers contain information about linear and patchy woody vegetation outside forest, with the exception of artificial tree rows like orchards, tree plantation or vineyards.

-   Linear structures include:

    -   Hedgerows

    -   Tree alignments or scrubs along field margins

    -   Tree alignments or scrubs along roads

    -   Riparian woody vegetation along waterways and streams

-   Patchy structures include:

    -   Scattered group of trees/scrubs

    -   Isolated trees/scrubs

No height differentiation (trees vs. scrubs/bushes) is applied.

Elements to be included or excluded in Small Woody Features 2021 are summarised in Table 2.

TABLE 2:THEMATIC DEFINITION OF SWF 2021

| Elements included in small woody features | Elements excluded from small woody features |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| \- linear hedgerows and scrubs <br> - tree rows (along field boundaries) <br> - isolated/scattered patches of trees areas, storm damages, insect-infested damages, etc.) | \- stone walls <br> - drainage ditches <br> - grass margins <br> - field boundaries without hedgerows or trees <br> - any kind of “grey” infrastructure such as roads <br> - artificial tree rows like olive tree plantations, vineyards, and orchards |

To ensure connectivity between mapped linear and patchy elements, features that are outside of the geometric specification can be included in the product if they are:

-   Connected to a valid (e.g., geometrically compliant) linear or patch, with no min/max criterion;

-   Isolated and with an area comprised between 0.15 and 5 ha.

Furthermore, SWF 2021 includes a forest masking, preventing any mapping of SWF in forested areas. These forested areas are aligned with canopy cover criteria of the FAO forest definition[^4] and are derived from HRL VLCC TCD 2021 and HRL VLCC CTY 2021 products (cf. section 0).

[^4]: In Forest Resources Assessment 2020 terms and definitions, the forest is described as "Land spanning more than 0.5 hectares with trees higher than 5 meters and a canopy cover of more than 10 percent, or trees able to reach these thresholds in situ. It does not include land that is predominantly under agricultural or urban land use." https://www.fao.org/3/I8661EN/i8661en.pdf

The small woody feature information is provided in 3 different layers:

-   Small Woody Features 5m raster layer

-   Small Woody Features vector layer

-   Small Woody Features 100m raster layer (density of SWF)

### Street Tree Layer

Street Tree Layer provides information about presence of trees within urban areas as defined by CLMS Urban Atlas Functional Urban Areas (FUA).

It includes contiguous rows or patches of trees covering 500m² or more and with a minimum width (MMW) of 10m over Artificial surfaces (nomenclature class 1) inside each FUA covered by Urban Atlas 2021, without including trees along road or railway networks connecting cities and villages.

This layer is provided as a vector layer.

### Change Layer

Small Woody Features Change 2018-2021 product aims to map, at 100m only, SWF increase, decrease or stable levels. It is based on difference between status products of the corresponding reference years with additional filtering and decision trees to discriminate real changes from technical changes.

### Auxiliary Layers

#### Parent Scene Identification Layer (PSIL)

This vector layer includes the reference to any data source which was used as a direct input for the classification process and therefore allows to precisely trace which data from which period was used to derive the final products.

#### WVL confidence layer

This layer provides useful supplemental information about the product’s quality and reliance of mapped features. It allows users to take into account the different reliability of the SWF product, e.g., caused by input data quality, and e.g., exclude information with high uncertainty from further analysis.

#### Forest Mask

To limit overlaps of SWF with large and densely tree covered areas, the production workflow for the 2021 update includes a masking approach using the HRL 2021 VLCC TCD layer. This mask follows as much as possible the FAO forest definition while considering landscape specifications to exclude from the forest mask valid SWF.

#### Crop Mask

To limit overlaps of SWF with crop areas, and especially permanent crops which are excluded from the SWF definition, a crop mask is derived to apply a dedicated post-processing over crop areas. This layer is derived from HRL VLCC CTY 2021 and consists of CTY classes converted into a binary layer crop/non-crop.

### Reference Data

#### Reference data for training and calibration

This database contains reference data used for training and calibrate classification algorithms across European landscapes. It consists of areas of 2.5x2.5km labelled as woody / non-woody landcover.

#### Reference data for validation

This database contains reference data used for internal verification of SWF layers thematic accuracy. It consists of areas of 100x100m labelled as SWF/non-SWF.

## Known thematic overlaps of the product

HRL SLF products present few thematic overlaps with other CLMS products.

Woody Vegetation Layer

HRL SLF WVL, by mapping trees across Europe, overlaps with the HRL VLCC Forest and HRL VLCC Crop Type layers. While WVL presents more detailed spatial resolution, the HRL VLCC layers are theme-specific and present additional information about tree density, leaf type or crop types. The HRL SLF Forest and Crop Masks allow users to identify precisely areas where these CLMS products overlaps with the HRL WVL.

### Small Woody Features layers

HRL SLF SWF partially overlaps with the HRL VLCC Forest layers, due to its very nature: mapping trees outside forested areas. Although forested areas are excluded from SWF based on the HRL VLCC Forest, the applied definition of the Forest Mask (cf. section 7.2) implies an overlap between the SWF layers and the HRL VLCC Forest layers. While SWF provides a more detailed mapping of trees outside forests due to its 5m spatial resolution, the HRL VLCC layers provide annual updates and more detailed thematic information about their respective topics.

Street Tree Layer

Focused on urban areas mapped by CLMS Urban Atlas, STL overlaps UA LULC product and provide additional information about presence of trees within cities.

# Production methodology and workflow overview

This section provides an overview of the methods and workflow used for production of SLF 2021 products. Details, illustrations and more advanced concepts are described in the HRL SLF ATBD document. Details about internal verification (accuracy assessment) can be found in the Product Delivery and Quality Control Report. Details about external validation can be found in the Validation Report.

## Preprocessing of EO data

The EO data processing involves two datasets: VHR_IMAGE_2021 and Sentinel-2. The VHR_IMAGE_2021 dataset, collected from ESA’s DWH, was resampled to 2m spatial resolution and converted to 8-bit COG format for bulk automated image processing.

The Sentinel-2 processing workflow began with time-series data of Sentinel-2 L2A products, organized per tile in the UTM projection, and made accessible through various cloud providers. The analysis included all 10m and 20m spectral bands, as well as the Scene Classification Layer (SCL) for cloud weighting. Within a standard year, all available scenes were composited into cloud-free images, one per band, by calculating the 20th percentile for each tile and band. Additionally, a 90th-percentile NDVI layer was generated and used as input for training and classification. The time-series observations capture intra-annual land cover variations, which were extracted using an ordinary least squares fit to a sinusoidal function. This methodology was optimized for robustness and resource efficiency, generating key layers that served as input for the deep learning algorithm.

## WVL 2021 processing

For the production of WVL 2021, a reference database for calibration was essential for supervised land cover classification from optical satellite imagery. The reference dataset, representative of the LC of interest and covering the whole EEA38 territory, was selected automatically based on a stratified approach. Each reference sample consists of a 2560x2560m cell containing woody vs non-woody information. The geographic distribution of the reference training samples included the UK, ensuring consistency between the reference dataset and EO dataset.

The model training and prediction involved two classification steps: VHR and Sentinel-2. For VHR imagery classification, a pre-trained foundation model for remote sensing analysis was adapted for segmentation of trees from the EO data. The model, based on a Swin Transformer with a U‑Net segmentation head, was fine-tuned using VHR_IMAGE_2021 and the reference database.

The Sentinel-2 classification leveraged a modified U-Net architecture. Despite its lower spatial resolution compared to VHR datasets, Sentinel-2’s higher acquisition frequency and higher spectral resolution enhanced the classification process. The U-Net architecture can produce outputs at finer resolutions, a process known as "super resolution," which has been used to generate high-resolution delineations of tree lines and single trees. For SWF production, this technique predicted woody vegetation probabilities at 5m resolution, facilitating a seamless comparison of maps generated from both VHR and Sentinel-2 datasets.

The combination of VHR and HR classification steps involved combining probability maps from respective VHR and Sentinel-2 classification through a set of decision rules to obtain the WVL 2021.

## SWF and derived products processing

The merged result from the previous step was used as input for producing the final output, which includes raster products at 5m and 10m resolutions, as well as a vector product. The process involved several steps:

First, a Forest Mask was created from HRL VLCC TCD 2021, applying a 10% canopy cover threshold to meet the FAO forest definition. A morphological filter removed linear elements, and a minimal mapping unit of 5 ha was applied to exclude small forest areas. A 10m external buffer prevents wrongly detected SWF at forest boundaries, and areas covered by the crop mask are excluded.

CLMS_PUM_HRLSLF_v1.0.docx0.3

Next, a Crop Mask was created from the HRL VLCC CTY 2021 product, representing crop areas in a binary format. This mask excludes crop areas, ensuring only non-agricultural woody vegetation is included in the analysis.

Raster Property Extraction involved calculating geometric and spatial properties to distinguish linear and patchy features. Distance transform calculation, erosion and dilation operations, and connected component analysis were performed. Properties such as width, area, and agricultural coverage percentage were calculated for each component.

Raster to Vector Conversion transformed the raster data into a spatial database, where key properties were calculated for each feature. Features were classified and simplified based on their properties, and those not meeting specifications were filtered out. Connected features not covered by the crop mask were reintroduced.

Finally, the remaining features were simplified using the Douglas-Peucker algorithm and converted back into raster format. The primary raster product was generated at 5m resolution, with a 100m version created using mean aggregation. The final geometries are stored in a Geopackage format. The final outputs of this steps include SWF 5m raster, SWF vector and SWF 100m raster. The same approach was applied, with corresponding specifications, to derive STL from WVL over the extent of urban areas extracted from Urban Atlas 2021.
