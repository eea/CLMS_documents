# Executive summary

The Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) provides geospatial information on land cover  and its changes, land use, vegetation state, water cycle and Earth's surface energy variables to  a broad range of users in Europe and across the World in the field of environmental terrestrial  applications. It supports applications in a variety of domains such as spatial and urban planning,  forest management, water management, agriculture and food security, nature conservation and  restoration, rural development, ecosystem accounting and mitigation/adaptation to climate  change. CLMS is jointly implemented by the European Environment Agency (EEA) and the  European Commission DG Joint Research Centre (JRC) and has been operational since 2012.

CLCplus Backbone constitutes the first component of CLMS’ CLCplus Product Suite, which  represents a true paradigm change in European land cover/land use monitoring, building on the  rich legacy of the European CORINE Land Cover (CLC) flagship product. The CLCplus Backbone is  a large scale, seamless and high-resolution inventory of European land cover. It covers the whole  of EEA38 territory, the United Kingdom (UK) and the French Overseas Departments (DOMs). The  CLCplus Backbone products are freely available, enabling the use by a broad audience, for a wide  range of applications.

The CLCplus Backbone 2023 is a geospatial raster product containing 11 basic land cover classes and is based on a time series of high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite imagery. The input timeseries for this 2023 production covers the reference year ± three months, i.e. 01.10.2022 to  31.03.2024, which is needed to enable the distinction of the 11 land cover classes. CLCplus  Backbone maps the dominant (spatially and temporally throughout the specific reference year)  land cover for each 10m-raster cell (pixel), applying specific rules according to a comprehensive  decision tree. The product has first been produced for the reference year 2018, has been  updated for 2021 (excluding the UK) and now as well for 2023, switching to a biennial update  cycle and re-including the UK.

This document constitutes the Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document (ATBD), providing a  description of the product characteristics, as well as the production methodologies and  workflows of the CLCplus Backbone 2023 and the additional quality products.

Figure 1: General workflow of the CLCplus Backbone 2023 production.

### 3.1.3 Input data

The main input data source for the raster classification was Sentinel-2 (S-2) time-series data, covering a period of 1.5 years, i.e. the reference year ±3 months. Since the production of the  reference year 2021, the input time series was shortened to the reference year ±3 months  compared to the reference year 2018 which was still produced with reference year ±6 months.  This change was performed in order to reduce the data volume and processing efforts, and to  enable a timelier production of the respective reference years. 

Initially, all S-2 scenes at processing level L2A and with a cloud coverage lower than 80% were  retrieved from Amazon Web Services (AWS), where the S-2 data is available as Cloud Optimized  GeoTIFFs (COGs). If already available at the time of the production start (i.e. beginning of April 2024), Collection-1 data (i.e. ESA S-2 processing baseline ≥ 5.0) was used. If for a certain part of  the production AOI and/or time within the reference period, Collection-1 was not available, the  time series was complemented with pre-Collection 1 data (i.e. ESA S-2 processing baseline 4.00). This was mainly the case for the period from October to December 2022.

Cloud-masks were computed using the Scene Classification Layer (SCL) provided with each L2A  scene by ESA. The S-2 COGs were processed in their native WGS84 UTM projection. After  masking out clouds and cloud shadows, all valid observations were taken into account to  interpolate an equidistant time-series with a 10-day interval (resulting in a total of 54 timesteps). This processing step included the S-2 bands B1, B3, B4, B5, B8, B9, B11, B12 and four  spectral indices, i.e. the Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), the Normalized  Difference Water Index (NDWI), the Normalized Difference Moisture Index (NDMI) and the  Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR). The included 20m S-2 bands were therefore resampled to 10m  spatial resolution, applying nearest neighbour resampling. The resulting inputs for the  classification were therefore 12 separate raster layers for all features (i.e. 8 S-2 bands and 4  spectral indices), each containing 54 raster bands with the values of the 54 equidistant time  steps, described above. 

The use of the above bands and indices turned out to provide the best ratio of processing effort  and resulting quality. Additional input data to support the classification in particularly difficult  areas (i.e. Sentinel-1 time-series, mono-temporal auxiliary features extracted from DEMs,  distance features derived from existing LC/LU maps) were extensively tested at several test sites  during the ramp up phase of the CLCplus Backbone 2018 production. Nevertheless, these tests  demonstrated, that the inclusion of such additional features did in most cases not lead to any  significant accuracy gains. Considering the overhead in terms of implementation, I/O and  computational footprints, such additional data sources were finally not integrated in the  workflow for the CLCplus Backbone production. Additional sampling and post-processing  strategies were found more efficient, to address remaining issues in the classification results in  difficult regions1. 

The training and test data required for the model calibration was based on the sample data base  (Sample DB) from the 2018 production, which was compiled from various sources, i.e. from  adjusted and filtered LUCAS 2018 data, from stratified automated land cover class annotations  based on existing CLMS land cover products, as well as from additional visual sample point  photo-interpretation that was supported by VHR imagery, NDVI time series and other auxiliary  datasets. The latter comprise available national LC datasets, aerial imagery and LiDAR data that  were all collected by a European network of involved regional experts back then. The Sample DB  has previously been updated for the CLCplus Backbone 2021 reference year production. Another  update and revision of the contained training samples was performed for the 2023 reference year (see section b. Model training in chapter 3.1.5) to account for land cover changes since the previous production and to assure the highest possible quality of the training data. In total, the Sample DB comprised more than 1 million sample points.

### 3.1.4 Production units

The first CLCplus Backbone raster production for the reference year 2018 was stratified into 232  Production Units (PUs) with an average size of approximately 28,000km². The units were  delineated targeting homogeneous environmental characteristics based on the Global  Environmental Zones (GEnZ version 3) as described by Metzger et al. (2013). The aim of this  stratification was to enable a better regional calibration of the model(s) and hence higher  accuracies.

With the CLCplus Backbone 2021 production, the United Kingdom (UK) was excluded and the  remaining 223 PUs were aggregated to 132 PUs, as the 2018 production had shown that it would  be possible to aggregate some PUs with similar bio-geographical conditions, while retaining  good regional calibrations at the same time. As the UK officially re-joined Copernicus in 2024, its  territory was added to the ongoing production of the reference year 2023. Accordingly, the PU  layout was adapted to now contain 138 PUs that cover the full production area, i.e. the  EEA38+UK and the 5 French DOMs. Figure 2 shows the outlines of the PUs for the CLCplus  Backbone 2023 production (without the French DOMs).

Figure 2: Production Units (without French DOMs) for the CLCplus Backbone 2023 production and Global Environmental Zones in the background (GEnZ version 3 according to Metzger et  al. 2013).

The homogenous character of the PUs facilitated the regional calibration of the land cover  classification models that were trained specifically for each PU. Furthermore, the partitioning  allowed to orchestrate and distribute the computation efficiently. The production was generally performed with a spatial overlap of 10 km to neighbouring PU in order to enable post-hoc border harmonization and to avoid any border effects.

### 3.1.5 Time series classification

The time series classification comprises three main steps, which are described in detail in the following sections:

#### a. Time series extraction

The S-2 input data time series, as described in section 3.1.3, was in a first step only computed  for the training sample locations (i.e. single 10m pixels) and stored per sample point in a  dedicated database. This approach enabled an efficient model training as it reduced the data  processing effort to a minimum. In a second step, the time series was extracted for the complete  Sample DB (see section 3.1.3) of the EEA38+UK area and subsequently used for the separate  training of classification models per PU as described below.

#### b. Model training

The training of classification models was performed in an iterative manner and initially using all training samples from the Sample DB (see section 3.1.3) for a specific PU to train and test models  in several stages. The classifier applied was a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network  (TempCNN, Pelletier et al. 2019), which proved to be robust, accurate and efficient for operational, large-area analysis of satellite image time series and to outperform well-known classification algorithms such as Random Forest or Recurrent Neural Networks. A cyclic learning  rate schedule was used which is known to yield higher accuracies compared to the training,  described in the original paper by Pelletier et al. (2019).

The initialmodel training process included an integrated outlier detection using the open-source  Python package Cleanlab v2.6.3. (Northcutt et al., 2021) to identify samples where the assigned  class label from the previous production deviated from the expected (i.e. modelled)  characteristics for the class. This outlier detection was implemented in 15 iterations, where the  train and test set compositions changed for each iteration. All samples flagged as potentially  conflicting in each of the 15 iterations were finally extracted. The potentially erroneous samples were then reviewed by thematic experts and the class code was updated where land cover change has occurred since the previous production (or in case the sample had been mislabelled  in the previous production). Subsequently, the model was trained and tested again with the  updated sample data base. In this iteration, 20% of the samples were withheld from training to  facilitate model testing and the retrieval of accuracy statistics. Where necessary, the process of  sample revisions was repeated until the accuracy metrics achieved with the test set indicated that the product target accuracies were reached.

As a final step, the PU-specific models were trained using all available training samples for the model training, i.e. without splitting the samples into train and test sets. This ensured that the final models were trained on the best-available sample base.

#### c. Roll out

The trained models were then used to roll out the raster classification to the whole PUs. To this end, the time series data had to be computed with full coverage. The spatial units for this computation were tiles of 25 x 25km (instead of full S-2 scenes) to increase computational performance. The tile grid was nested in the S-2 tile grid to ensure positional accuracy and compliance of all data. 

In a second step, the classification was performed on the trained model and input data time  series. The classification output was a probability raster with eleven bands - each band representing the per-pixel probabilities for each of the eleven classes. This interim result was  then input to the post-processing, as described in the following section.

### 3.1.6 Post-processing

The post-processing steps applied to the interim per-pixel class probability raster are described in the following sub-sections.

#### a. Bilateral filtering

A bilateral filter was applied to the class probabilities to reduce the salt and pepper noise (i.e.  scattered and isolated pixelsthat are wrongly classified as a result of noise contained in the input  imagery and the classification algorithm) in the classification while preserving edges. This type  of filter was chosen as it is known to provide a good compromise between computational  complexity and accuracy improvements (Schindler 2012). A small window size (win_size=4) and  low standard deviation (sigma_spatial=0.8; sigma_color=0.25) was used to parametrize the  filter in a way that favoured the preservation of small details while still reducing label noise  significantly.

#### b. Blending

The training data used for model calibration of neighbouring PUs was created with some overlap  to ensure consistency in the classification of neighbouring PUs. Nevertheless, differences in the  model calibration could still lead to undesired edge effects at the borders of PUs. To circumvent  this issue, each PU was initially produced with a buffer of 10km to always ensure an overlap of  20 km between neighbouring PUs. Within this overlap, a distance-weighted averaging of the  classification probabilities was performed so that probabilities from both models had equal  weights at the centre of the overlap area and de-/increasing weights as a function of the distance  from the centre of the overlap.

#### c. Interannual calibration

Finally, the 2023 class probabilities were calibrated with the combined 2018/2021 probabilities to create best-possible consistency of the CLCplus BB product time series, while allowing for  changes in the class assignment where real land cover change or previous misclassifications  were detected. For each pixel, the combined probabilities considered the values of the 2018  probabilities where the CLCplus Backbone class remained the same in 2018 and 2021 as well as the values of the 2021 probabilities where it had changed from 2018 to 2021.

As such, the interannual calibration built around the computation of a pixel-based measure of  change between the prediction probabilities of 2018/2021 and 2023. Since the probabilities for  each of the 11 possible classes per pixel can be interpreted as a point in an 11-dimensional space,  the measure of change between two such points, i.e. the probabilities of 2018/2021 (p1821) and  2023 (p2023), can be defined as the Euclidean distance between them:

\[M_{c h a n g e}=\sqrt[2]{\sum_{i=1}^{11}(p_{2023}^{i}-p_{1821}^{i})^{2}}\]

The highest possible value for \(M_{c h a n g e}\) is given by a change between two class predictions made  with 100% certainty, as shown for a change from class 1 to class 2 here: 

\[\begin{array}{l}{{p_{2023}=(1\;0\;0\;0\;0\;0\;0\;0\;0\;0)}}\\ {{p_{1821}=(0\;1\;0\;0\;0\;0\;0\;0\;0\;0\;0)}}\\ {{M_{m e a s}^{m a x}=\;\sqrt[2]{2}=1.414\;...}}\end{array}\]

With the direction of change known from the comparison of the 2021 and 2023 prediction rasters, it further allowed the implementation of class-specific change thresholds (based on percentiles) and a categorization of pixels in the 2023 raster into low- and high-probability changes. For the majority of pixels experiencing changes between productions, a standard threshold (i.e. the 90th percentile) was used (in theory, 110 change directions are possible). However, change direction-specific thresholds were also applied for particular situations:

- very high thresholds for unreasonable changes,such as changes between tree leaf types (i.e. class 2 vs. class 3/4), and 

- lower thresholds between classes that are more reasonable and likely to change, such  as vegetated classes (especially classes 2-7) to Non-sparsely vegetated (class 9) and  Sealed (class 1) due to land conversion and/or construction activity).

Based on the above thresholds, changes in the assigned CLCplus Backbone class between 2021  and 2023 were allowed or suppressed, respectively.

#### d. Further optional post-processing

In cases where significant remaining misclassifications in the raster classification were detected  after the cross-calibration during the quality control, those were addressed with a  semiautomatic post-processing approach that defined the AOIs of misclassification and  subsequently corrected them using available external third-party datasets that had been  translated to the CLCplus Backbone nomenclature. This included the correction of omission and  commission of sealed surfaces based on the latest release (at the end of the reference period)  of Open Street Map (Geofabrik, 2024) and corrections for confusions between classes 6, 7 and  partially 5, leveraging data from the Land Parcel Information System (LPIS; where accessible for  an affected area). Further, where no adequate auxiliary data was available, a recoding was  alternatively based on the expertise of experienced interpreters, who identified the correct class  and defined the AOI where changes should be applied. All pixels adapted during this semiautomatic post-processing are documented in the Raster Post-Processing Layer (see section 3.4).

#### e. Coastal seawater buffer recoding

As a last step of the post-processing, the separation of the coastal seawater buffer area from  inland water, as introduced in the 2021 production, was performed to enable the derivation of  reliable inland water statistics also for countries with significant coastlines. This was done by  using the CLMS EU-Hydro coastline product (EEA, 2020) with further manually implemented  improvements and the Copernicus EEA39 Boundary Layer with 250 m buffer (EEA, 2019) to  derive a mask, covering the respective seawater areas. The underlying pixels were then recoded  to a unique raster code with the help of this masking layer. The naming and coding for this  technical class is ‘coastal seawater buffer’ with raster code 253, respectively. The raster code  253 is in the range of the outside area and the no data values (254 & 255), which separates it  from the 11 thematic land cover classes and does not imply a newly introduced thematic class.

### 3.1.7 Strengths and limitations of the applied methodology

The strongest point of the applied methodology is a generally high accuracy and robustness for  the majority of land cover classes and biogeographical regions. This is the result of several  elements including:

• The ingestion of a full time series of 1.5 years (i.e. 2023 ± 0.25 years) of Sentinel-2 data,  which comprises very rich information on the spectral-temporal dynamics of different  land cover classes. This generally enables a very good separability of the 11 target  classes and partially even compensates for known shortcomings in the Sentinel-2 L2A  input data, such as topographic over-normalization2 on north-to west-facing slopes.

• The usage of a state-of-the-art Deep Learning architecture that enables to fully leverage  the full time-series without the need for feature engineering orselection which typically  leads to a certain loss of information.

• A rich sample database of more than 1 million sample points, which have been allocated, curated and quality-checked based on various sources.

• A regional calibration approach, which allows to address regional differences and  particularly difficult cases in the classification.

• A tailored post-processing that comprises the reduction of label noise (i.e. bilateral  filtering), assurance of wall-to-wall consistency (i.e. blending) and consistency of the  CLCplus Backbone raster time series (i.e. cross-calibration), as well as rule-based  reduction of omission and commission errors.

Despite the excellent quality achieved with the applied methodology, some limitations remain.  It is worth mentioning, that areas of heterogeneous land cover and small landscape features  typically cause an uncertainty due to mixed spectral and temporal signals. Particularly, the  classes Low-growing woody plants (class 5) and Lichens and mosses (class 8) have some inherent  uncertainty due to i) some fuzziness in the class definition, ii) limited spectral-temporal  separability and/or iii) limited reference data, in particular in remote areas. All three factors  mentioned above can only be resolved to a certain extent, considering the largely automated  approach and the requirements for the timely availability of the product. To a lesser degree, this  also concerns areas with intensively managed grassland, where the non-/exposure of bare soil  within the reference year cannot always be determined from the input time series with last  certainty. As such, confusions of permanent and periodically herbaceous areas (classes 6 vs. 7) may occur.

## 3.2 Raster Confidence Layer (RASCL)

The Raster Confidence Layer (RASCL) provides information on the confidence of the classifier in  the class assignment of each 10m pixel.

### 3.2.2 Production algorithm and methodology

The RASCL value was calculated for each pixel as the difference between the highest class  probability (i.e. the probability of the class that was assigned to the pixel) minus the second  highest class probability. This so called (confidence-) margin is conceptually simple, robust and  well adapted for multi-class classification problems with variable number of classes. The higher  the confidence value, the more reliable the class assignment for a pixel, and vice versa. The value  range of RASCL is 0-100.

## 3.3 Raster Data Score Layer (RASDL)

The Data Score Layer (RASDL) quantifies the number of valid observations in the S-2 image time  series which were the input for the equidistant time series interpolation to 10-day intervals.

### 3.3.2 Production algorithm and methodology

As mentioned above, the RASDL quantifies the number of valid observations in the input time  series. A valid observation is in the first place defined as a cloud-free and (cloud-) shadow-free  pixel in aS-2 acquisition.

As a preselection, only S-2 acquisitions with an overall cloud coverage below 80% (according to  S-2 L2A metadata) were considered for the classification to reduce the data volume and avoid  the processing of non-usable image data. The selected S-2 images were then masked based on  cloud masks, created for each acquisition, based on the Scene Classification Layer (SCL) provided  with the S-2 data. The SCL classes, used for masking the data were classes 2 (dark  features/shadows), 3 (cloud shadows), 8 (cloud medium probability) and 9 (cloud high  probability). The remaining cloud-free and (cloud-) shadow-free pixels are considered a valid  observation and were being counted for each 10m pixel for the complete time window of the  reference year ±3 months, i.e. 1.5 years. This count is then stored in a dedicated raster layer.

## 3.4 Raster Post-Processing Layer (RASPL)

The Raster Post-Processing Layer (RASPL) provides information, if a pixel’s class has been  adapted during the optional post processing routine (described in section 3.1.6).

### 3.4.1 Technical product specifications

### 3.4.2 Production algorithm and methodology

The RASPL provides information, if a pixel’s class code has been adapted during the postprocessing. This excludes potential changes coming from the bilateral filtering and the  interannual calibration, being part of the general post-processing, but forming integral  processing steps towards the initial class assignment. Only pixels that were changed thereafter,  i.e. in the additional optional post-processing steps for further refinement of the initial class  assignment, are flagged as ‘Recoded during post-processing’ in the RASPL. 

The adapted areas are simply identified by a comparison of the final classification result with the  interim outcome after the interannual calibration step. Where the assigned class codes do not  match, the pixels are assigned with value 1 and value 0 is assigned to all unchanged pixels.
