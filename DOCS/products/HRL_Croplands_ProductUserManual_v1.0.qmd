# Executive summary

Copernicus is the European Union's Earth Observation Programme. It
offers information services based on satellite Earth observation and in
situ (non-space) data. These information services are freely and openly
accessible to its users through six thematic Copernicus services
(Atmosphere Monitoring, Marine Environment Monitoring, Land Monitoring,
Climate Change, Emergency Management and Security).

The **Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS)** provides geographical
information on land cover and its changes, land use, vegetation state,
water cycle and earth surface energy variables to a broad range of users
in Europe and across the world in the field of environmental terrestrial
applications.

CLMS is jointly implemented by the **European Environment Agency (EEA)**
and the European Commission’s DG **Joint Research Centre (JRC).**

The **High-Resolution Layer (HRL)** Vegetated land cover characteristics
are a set of harmonised yearly maps dedicated to the thematic themes
**Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands and Croplands**. Those include a rich
suite of raster products mapping the yearly status of those land cover
types at a spatial resolution of 10 meters and change layers at 3-yearly
interval and 20-meter resolution. HRL vegetated land cover
characteristics extends the time-series of the existing HRL’s Tree Cover
& Forests and Grasslands and complements the CLMS portfolio with new
layer dedicated to the mapping of crop types and agricultural practices
such as mowing, harvest and cover crops.

# Lineage of HRL Tree Cover and Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands

**High Resolution Layers (HRL)** on **Tree Cover & Forests** had already
been established in the **Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS)**
portfolio since the reference years 2012 producing initially a
**Dominant Leaf Type**, a **Tree Cover Density**, and a **Forest Type**
map at a spatial resolution of 20 meters (Figure 3-1). Change layers and
reference datasets were included with the reference year 2015. At the
same time the accuracy targets were raised towards at least 90% user’s
and producer’s accuracy. A further important step followed with the
first production for the reference years 2018 (further referred to as
**Historic HRL Forest 2018**) where the spatial resolution of the status
layers was raised to 10 meters, the implementation of the change layers
was partially reconsidered and target accuracies for the change layers
were defined. In addition, new aggregated layer depicting the density of
coniferous and broadleaved tree cover was introduced. With the **HRL
Tree Cover & Forests** starting from the reference year 2018 the product
specifications have been kept largely in line with the definitions used
for the Historic HRL Forest 2018 whereas major changes concerned in
particular the move to a yearly update cycle for the status layers and
changes to some confidence layers (not shown in Figure 3-1). The new HRL
Tree Cover & Forests therefore replace and extend the Historic HRL
Forest 2018. This does not include an update of the change layer 2015 –
2018; the new status layers for 2018 are therefore not consistent with
the original change layers 2015 – 2018.

HRL’s on **Grasslands** had already been established in the Copernicus
Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) portfolio since the reference years 2015
producing initially a status layer on the absence / presence of
grassland (Figure 3-1) with a target Overall Accuracy of 85%. With the
reference year 2018 the spatial resolution of the status layers was
raised to 10 meters and a change layer with a target Overall Accuracy of
80% was introduced. With the **HRL Grasslands** starting from the
reference year 2018 the product specifications have been kept largely in
line with the definitions used for the **Historic HRL Grassland 2018**
whereas major changes concerned in particular the move to a yearly
update cycle for the status layers, an additional yearly **Herbaceous
Cover layer (HER)** (including also temporary grassland in the reference
year), new layers on the count and timing of Grassland Mowing (Minimum
Mapping Unit (MMU) of 0.25 ha) and changes to some confidence layers
(not shown in detail in Figure 3-1). The new HRL Grasslands therefore
replaces and extends the Historic HRL Grassland 2018. This does not
include an update of the change layer 2015 – 2018; the new status layers
for 2018 are therefore not consistent with the original change layers
2015 – 2018.

The **HRL Croplands** is a new set of layers dedicated to agriculture
and comprises several yearly layers mapping crop types (10-metre spatial
resolution) and agricultural practices such as harvest, fallow land and
secondary crops (10-metre spatial resolution, Minimum Mapping Unit of
0.25 ha).

# Review of User Requirements

In the frame of the **Horizon 2020 (H2020)** project **ECoLaSS** a
survey \[5\] of key stakeholders has been performed in order to evaluate
the user requirements towards the evolution of existing and future
**Copernicus** products. This survey made also use of the results from
the Nextspace User Study \[6\] and revealed that **HRL** users like
European institutions, service industry, research and academia, national
agencies, regional administrations, NGS or private users would in
general appreciate:

-   High thematic quality/meaningful and application-oriented product
    definitions;

-   Sufficient spatial and timely resolution concerning both, status
    layer and change layer;

-   Short update cycles;

-   Change monitoring;

-   Free and open access;

-   High technical quality;

-   Standardized and comparable nomenclature;

-   Transparent and scientific workflows and state-of-the-art
    methodology;

-   Detailed documentation of these workflow and the respective
    methodology;

-   Consistency of the Pan-European products enabling synergistic use of
    all products;

-   Streamlining the pan-European product with global ones;

-   Availability of historic data and compatibility of time series;

-   Open access to the original Copernicus Sentinel data;

-   Sophisticated product presentation and visualisation possibilities
    in an online viewer on the Copernicus platform;

-   IPCC conformity.

While many of these requirements had already been satisfied with
previous HRL reference years some could only be implemented within the
current update:

-   A long-standing thematic gap in the European **CLMS** portfolio
    concerning the monitoring of agriculture has been addressed though
    new products on crop types and agricultural activities. This also
    improves the separation between grassland and cropland and the IPCC
    conformity;

-   Yearly update cycle for status layer;

-   Grassland use intensity (or the dynamics of intensification/
    extensification) is partially addressed through a new product on
    Grassland mowing.

Further requirements that remain to be considered for future updates are
for example:

-   More fine-grained differentiation among species-rich (extensively
    used) and separation from species-poor (intensively used) and
    managed grassland;

-   Tree-species compositions and shifts between extensive and intensive
    management;

-   Increased timeliness of availability of the products: The mid-term
    goal is a product provision at latest 12 months after the end of the
    reference year.

# Product structure - What are the High Resolution Layers?

The **High Resolution Layers (HRL)** vegetated land cover
characteristics portfolio consists of **Tree Cover & Forests**,
**Grasslands** and **Croplands** products (Figure 5-1), which together
cover most of what is defined as the Biotic component of the **EAGLE**
Land Cover Components[^1]. More specifically, the mapping is focused on
surfaces with a vegetation cover above 30%; an exception to this is tree
cover where the objective is to map tree cover with a continuous range
of 1-100% **Tree Cover Density (TDC)**, i.e. also below 30%, as far as
detectable from 10-metre resolution satellite imagery. This definition
is also in line with the Sparsely Vegetated class in the **Corine Land
Cover (CLC)+ Backbone Raster**[^2] and considers that detection /
classification of vegetation below this threshold is typically more
error-prone. The definition also aims at largely avoiding overlaps with
the non-vegetated land cover characteristics such as **HRL
Imperviousness**, which is focused on areas with less than 10%
vegetation cover during any time of the year, for a reference period of
3 year.

[^1]: https://land.copernicus.eu/en/eagle?tab=technical_implementation

[^2]: https://land.copernicus.eu/en/technical-library/product-user-manual-clc-backbone-2021

Some overlaps between the three product groups are allowed by
definition, for example areas with tree crops (i.e. olive, fruit and nut
trees) which are included in both the Tree Cover & Forests and the
Croplands products. Furthermore, specific vegetations types are not
included in the HRLVLCC portfolio; this concerns areas dominated by
natural shrubs (i.e. shrubs that are not under agricultural use) and
associations of lichens and mosses.

![Figure 5-1: Products within the HRL vegetated land cover
characteristics.](HRL_Croplands_ProductUserManual_v1.0-media/img-5ffcb441cde1eb0e5c25696fe98984f1817eb864.png)

Given several interdependencies and potential overlaps among the
**Grasslands, Croplands and Tree Cover & Forests** products, the overall
workflow starts with the classification of **Base Vegetation Layer
(BVL)**. A high-level description is provided for the overall workflow
in Figure 5-2. The yearly BVL classification initially targets the
separation of five basic land cover classes being:

1.  herbaceous vegetation;

2.  cropland;

3.  tree cover;

4.  tree crops (i.e. nomenclature overlap between broadleaved tree cover
    and permanent crops in the Croplands product);

5.  background class (including bare and sparsely vegetated areas and
    non-agricultural shrubs);

In a subsequent post-processing step two further classes are derived to
delineate the:

6.  potential overlap herbaceous – cropland (i.e. pixels which are
    classified as cropland and herbaceous at least once in the
    time-series);

7.  The second derived class is derived from the intersection of all
    areas classified as tree cover and a preliminary version of the Tree
    Cover Density to delineate areas with low Tree Cover Density and
    hence allowed overlaps of herbaceous and tree cover.

The derived yearly BVL is considered for the downstream productions of
Grasslands, Croplands and Tree Cover & Forests products as follows:

-   For the production of the Grasslands layers: all areas classified as
    herbaceous, overlap herbaceous – tree cover, or overlap herbaceous –
    Cropland are considered as the potential maximum extent for the
    **Herbaceous Cover (HER)** layer. In addition, the BVL
    classification probabilities for the herbaceous class are used as
    the main input for the derivation of the **HER** layer.

-   For the Croplands layers: the areas delineated as cropland, overlap
    herbaceous –cropland, or Tree Crops are considered as the maximum
    extent for the **CTY** classification and further refinement.

-   For the **Tree Cover & Forests** layers: the areas classified as
    tree cover, overlap herbaceous – tree cover, tree crops and the
    respective probabilities are used directly to derive the respective
    change layers and yearly **DLT** and **TCD** status layers.

Within the areas identified as overlap herbaceous – cropland, a further
harmonization step is carried out downstream. To this end the **CTY**
classification initially includes a class for fodder crops which are
transferred to the **HER** layer if occurring in the designated overlap
class.

Vegetation Layer and the subsequent production of Grasslands, Croplands
and Tree Cover & Forests
products](HRL_Croplands_ProductUserManual_v1.0-media/img-813e9da3364258b08029cd0fa0b27a1c92440fc4.png)

# Product application areas and examples of use cases

The **HRL Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands** and **Croplands** set of
products is designed for use by a broad user community as basis for
environmental and regional analysis and for supporting political
decision-making, such as the **Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), LULUCF
(Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry)** regulation, the **Nature
Restoration Regulation (NRR)**, or the proposed European **Forest
Monitoring Law (FML)**. With the new products the **EEA** will ensure
continuity and further densification of the well-established HRL Tree
Cover & Forests and Grasslands product time series. Those include a rich
suite of raster products at a 3-yearly interval mapping the status of
those land cover types with a spatial resolution of 10-meter and change
layers at 20-meter spatial resolution.

As an example, the following sections provide short information on
(potential) use cases at national level, for which the **Copernicus HRL
Croplands** product represent a fundamental input.

## Use case: C3/C4 crops specific parametrization for biomass monitoring.

The **HRL Crop Types (CTY)** layer offers comprehensive information on
various crop types, allowing for further differentiation between C3 and
C4 crops (if class not mixed-up). Maize, being the most common C4 crop
cultivated in Europe could be easily derived from this dataset. By
providing detailed information on crop types and their specific
locations, the **CTY** layer enables the use of tailored parameters for
biomass estimation at C3/C4 crop locations on an annual basis. This
information is particularly relevant for on-going work within the
Evoland[^3] project, where the enhancement of biomass mapping for both
crop and grassland areas is envisaged. In this respect, the reliability
of the biomass mapping could benefit from the availability of this
detailed crop type information. Moreover, the distinction between C3 and
C4 crops is useful for better estimating autotrophic respiration, which
in turn allows for more accurate conversions of gross primary
productivity to net primary productivity. Given that C3 and C4 crops
have distinct photosynthetic pathways and respiration rates, this
differentiation supports the use of more precise parameters in
productivity models, contributing to enhanced biomass mapping across
crop landscapes.

## Use case: Land cover specific monitoring

Detailed and dynamic information on the state of the land as provided by
the **HRL Croplands** layers allows to analyse regional trends in the
area occupied by these land covers, which could be relevant information
for authorities and policy makers. Furthermore, applications which
require information on the land cover status can benefit from the HRL
Croplands. For example, in case of biomass mapping often land cover
specific parametrization is applied. Using **HRL Croplands**, allows to
do this in a much more detailed and dynamic way. In case of the Evoland
project, it is intended to use these layers to apply specific
parametrization over crop and grassland locations.

# Product description

The **HRL Croplands** layers are generally provided in 100km Lambert
Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection tiles as shown in Figure 7-1. The
five French Oversea Territories are provided in UTM with the layout of
the respective territory. The layers are available as Cloud-Optimized
GeoTIFFs (COG) per reference year and 100km LAEA tile aligned with the
**EEA reference grid.** Each raster file is accompanied by a Persistent
Auxiliary Metadata (PAM) XML and an INSPIRE XML.

![Figure 7-1: LAEA tile layout incl. distinction between tiles to cover
EU27 and
EEA38.](HRL_Croplands_ProductUserManual_v1.0-media/img-7cbffb4e28195ea5f90ae8fdcbdb8a4a9911aed9.png)

The **HRL Croplands** information aims at filling the data gap needed
for detailed agricultural monitoring and enables repeatable and
harmonised continental scale assessments within the **CLMS** portfolio.
The **HRL Croplands** layers entail the mapping the extent of croplands
and crop types, delineation of parcel-complexes, mapping agricultural
practices on large scale and with wall-to-wall coverage and high spatial
details.

![Figure 7-2 HRL Croplands product
overview](HRL_Croplands_ProductUserManual_v1.0-media/img-28d04723d719e8d291ce78659563d3161bbfd274.png)

The primary layer is the yearly **Crop Types (CTY)** layer at 10m, which
maps the specific crop grown in the main growing season for all pixels
identified as arable or permanent crops by the **BVL**. Maximum
uniformity, comparability, and interpretability of the final product is
guaranteed across different regions in Europe by focusing on the main
growing season. Besides the **CTY** layer a supportive **Crop Types
Confidence Layer (CTYCL)** layer is provided to match the **CTY** layer.
**CTYCL** indicates the degree of confidence of the provided crop type
label. The probability value from the winning class as determined by the
model is taken as the confidence level.

Several further status **HRL Cropping Patterns (CP)** layers, covering 5
thematic domains, give information on the agricultural practices within
the classified cropland area for the following domains:

-   Main Crops;

-   Bare Soil;

-   Secondary Crops;

-   Fallow Land;

-   Cropping Seasons;

All the **CP** layers are only applied over annual arable land,
excluding permanent crops. Permanent crops do not have specific seasonal
cycles, which is the primary focus of the cropping pattern layers. The
workflow used to define the different agricultural practices is applied
at field level scale, to ensure homogeneity in the seasonal signal and
reduce signal noise. Afterwards, all the different layers are rasterized
and aligned on the same spatial grid as the **CTY** layer. Therefore,
only for those locations where initially a field could be delineated and
where it coincides with a classified annual cropland, the Cropping
Pattern layers are generated (excluding crop rotation layer, see last
paragraph of section). Since the MMU is applied to the originally
delineated parcel geometry used for defining CP information, further
alignment with annual cropland may result in smaller spatial patterns
due to the clipping of the original field boundaries. However, the CP
information itself remains based on an MMU of at least 0.25 ha, as it is
still derived from the original parcel geometry.

The **Main Crops (MC)** layers focus on the characteristics of the main
growing season which usually takes place during (part of) the summer
season. These layers provide information on the **emergence (CPMCE)**
and **harvest (CPMCH)** of the main growing season, as well as the
**duration of the season (CPMCD)**. Each of these layers include a
**Confidence Layer (CL)** that indicates the level of uncertainty in
days. Information on the characteristics of the growing season and its
variations over time give valuable information on how growing seasons
are impacted by (extreme) weather conditions and climate change at
regional and national levels.

The **Bare Soil (BS)** group of layers include information on the
duration of the bare soil period. Presence of a period of **Bare Soil
Before (CPBSB)** the emergence of the main crop season and **Bare Soil
After (CPBSA)** the harvest of the main crop season are evaluated. Both
layers also feature a CL that indicates the level of uncertainty in the
duration of the bare soil period in days. This uncertainty is based on
the uncertainty of the emergence and/or harvest events that define the
bare soil period. The bare soil period is only defined for the duration
within the reference year. Therefore, emergence events occurring after
the calendar year that marks the end of the bare soil period following
the main season will not be considered in the uncertainty calculation.
Similarly, for the bare soil period before the main season, if the
preceding harvest event took place in the previous calendar year, it
will not be included in the uncertainty calculation. Information of bare
soil periods are relevant for policy makers to assess the susceptibility
of soils to leaching and erosion.

The **Secondary Crops (SC)** group of layers provides information on
agricultural parcels where an off-season secondary growing season
occurs. Typically, this secondary season involves planting a cover crop
in the field. Secondary season presence in only evaluated if a main
season is detected. The secondary season is categorized into four
**Secondary Crop Types (CPSCT)** based on the emergence date and length
of the season: short/long summer and short/long winter secondary
seasons. In addition, to this classification, information on the
**Secondary Crop Emergence (CPSCE)** and **Secondary Crop Duration
(CPSCD)** of the season is included. Similarly, as for the **Main Crops
(MC)** layer, uncertainty information is provided for both the duration
and emergence of the secondary crops. The **SC** layers offer valuable
information for assessing policy implementation to prevent soil
degradation and monitoring cropping changes during off-season over time
at regional and national level.

The **Fallow Land (FL)** layers give information on **Fallow Land
Presence (CPFLP)** and **Fallow Land Duration (CPFLD)**. Fallow land
presence is defined as agricultural land where, temporarily, no
agricultural activity takes place. Fallow land duration indicates the
number of days a parcel is left fallow for the five-year period i.e.,
2017-2021. Both the **FLP** layer and the **FLD** layer have an
accompanying **Confidence Layer (CL)**.

Finally, the **Cropping Seasons** layers provide information on the
number of detected growing seasons in the **Cropping Seasons Yearly
(CPCSY)** layer and information on main crop rotation in the **Cropping
Seasons Types over 3 years (CPCST)** layer. The **CPCSY** layer is based
on the **CTY** and the **CPSCT** layers to count the number of growing
seasons in a specific year. **CPCST** is based on the crop diversity
count and contains the number of unique crop types grown in the main
agricultural season over a 3-year period. Since, **CPCST** is based on
information of previous year’s crop types, it is only available for the
2017-2019, 2018-2020, and 2019 till 2021 time periods. Furthermore, it
does not rely on the delineation of parcel complexes compared to the
other **CP** layers as it is a purely CTY based layer. Information on
crop rotation provides valuable insights to monitor the application of
monoculture or rotation cycle in specific regions.

## Thematic characteristics of the HRL Croplands layers

The **HRL Croplands** layers are only provided for those locations where
the **BVL** designates arable or permanent cropland (i.e., BVL classes
cropland, tree crops and overlap herbaceous and crops). For those
locations the pixel-based crop type algorithm classifies according to
the crop type grown in the **main growing season**. A main crop season
is defined as the most crucial period for cultivating crops of economic
value. Initially, the algorithm also classifies the grassland and
fodders crops that are present in the applied BVL mask (overlap
herbaceous and crops), but those locations are transferred to the
**Herbaceous Cover (HER)** layer (see 5.2). In Table 7-1, the final
mapped crop types and the aggregation levels of the hierarchical
nomenclature are given. The crop type aggregation level is used within
the **Crop Types (CTY)** layer. For those cases where the classification
algorithm remains undecided due to low confidence values, a separate
category is added, subdivided in unclassified arable and permanent crop.
This output is further spatially cleaned and harmonised over the years
to enhance temporal and spatial consistency of the product. As a result
of these post-processing steps, it might happen that there is some
minimal overlap between the **HRL Croplands** and **Grassland** layers
that are both located within the arable or permanent crops classes
defined by BVL \[7\]. This potential overlap can be present in the
published layers and solely occurs at borders between cropland and
temporary grassland.

![Table 7-1: HRL Crop Types nomenclature and aggregation
levels](HRL_Croplands_ProductUserManual_v1.0-media/image1.png)

The **emergence** and **harvest** detection are the main input for the
different **HRL Cropping Patterns (CP)** layers that provide information
on the agricultural practices. The following definitions of emergence
and harvest are used to detect these events from satellite imagery:

-   Emergence is defined as the moment when the first leaves of the crop
    unfold

-   Harvest is defined as the moment when all standing biomass is
    removed.

A **main crop season** is defined as the most crucial period for
cultivating crops of economic value. Expert rules, developed by
analysing seasonal boundaries in Europe and using USDA crop calendar
data, are used to classify seasons as main or secondary \[7\]. Region
specific seasonal boundaries are selected to reflect the seasonal shifts
across Europe. Additionally, rules for prioritization are established to
resolve conflicts in cases where multiple main seasons are possible. The
complete procedure for selecting the growing season is outlined in the
**ATBD**; while the detection is only performed for annual crops it is
fully independent from the crop type label of the annual crop defined in
the **CTY** layer \[7\]. However, due to the complexity of agricultural
patterns, there may be challenges in accurately distinguishing the main
season from the secondary season. This is particularly true in cases
where a very late onset of the main growing season follows on a season
with similar behaviour as winter cereals. Since the cultivation of
winter cereals is also considered, the main season onset may occur
before the reference year. Additionally, in rare instances, the harvest
of the main season crop may occur shortly after the end of the year. In
some situations, it is impossible to generate a **Cropping Pattern**
product for the **main crop** layer based on the defined seasonal
boundaries (i.e., season length should fall between 40 and 366 days,
period of main growing season) and the detection of emergence and
harvest events. In such cases, the corresponding pixels are flagged with
dedicated codes (see Table 7-7).

The **Secondary Crop (SC)** layers follow a similar methodology to the
main season classification, but with distinct seasonal boundaries based
on the emergence and harvest detected for the secondary crop. The
secondary season can occur both preceding and following the main growing
season, although preference is given to labelling a secondary season
that follows the main season when multiple instances arise. If there are
more than one seasonal signal after the main season within the same
calendar year, the **SC** product may not align with the actual cover
crop sown, but rather with a short-term crop planted in a double
cropping system. Each secondary crop season is subdivided into four
categories, short/long summer, and short/long winter secondary seasons.
A seasonal length shorter than 100 days is considered as a short growing
variant, otherwise it is a long variant. If the secondary crop emergence
is before September and takes place after the end of the main season, it
is a summer variant. In all other cases, it is a winter variant.

The **Bare Soil** layers indicate the period before and after the main
growing season when no crop cultivation activities occur. This period is
determined by the detection of emergence and harvest events within that
year in a particular field. Since a specific bare soil detection
algorithm is not employed, there may be instances where the field is not
completely bare during this period, possibly due to weed growth or the
presence of residual crop remnants. Additionally, activities such as
fertilization or ploughing of the field can fall within the bare soil
period.

The **Fallow Land** layers consider only delineated parcels that are
classified as annual cropland by the **CTY** layer, other parcels are
omitted for the fallow land evaluation. For the determination of fallow
land presence thematic rules, based on the expected behaviour of fallow
land, are used. The rules consider the average **Crop Types Confidence
Layer (CTYCL)**, the number and sequence of detected harvests and
emergences in combination with the maximum **fAPAR** value. Harvest
dates are used to determine the **fallow land duration.** Therefore, the
accuracy of the **fallow land layers** depends on the accuracy of the
**CTYCL**, the detected harvests and emergence, and the fAPAR
timeseries.

The **Cropping Seasons** layers provide insights into the annual crop
rotation strategy and the number of growing seasons at specific
locations. Note however that a maximum limit of two growing seasons is
considered. If more than two seasons are identified, they will not be
considered. Permanent crops are ignored in counting the crop diversity.

An overview of how cropping pattern layers(excluding Fallow Land and
Cropping Seasonslayers) can be generated at the field level based on the
identified emergence and harvest events within a six-month period before
and after the calendar year is given in Figure 7-3. The emergence and
harvest events are used to classify the season as either main or
secondary based on predefined seasonal boundaries. In the example shown
in Figure 7-3, the main season corresponds to a winter cereal, resulting
in no bare soil period before the main season for the reference year.
Instead, a bare soil period is indicated between the main and secondary
seasons, defined by the harvest of the main season and the emergence of
the secondary season. The secondary season is classified as a long
winter variant. The uncertainty surrounding fAPAR values around the
emergence and harvest events is utilized to generate the respective
**Confidence Layers.**

![Figure 7-3: Example how the different cropping patterns layers for a
barley field located in Belgium are generated for the reference year
2019. The season delineation is based on the predicted emergence (black
line) and harvest dates (red line). The green timeseries curve is the
daily fAPAR value (with uncertainty). BS after stands for the length of
the bare soil period after the main
season.](HRL_Croplands_ProductUserManual_v1.0-media/img-20a2715bee8dc05a32e7de5f76616c59ae86fb3e.png)

## Product characteristics and class codes

Table 7-6: Overview of the used quality flags within the HRL Croplands
layers

| Quality flag | Definition |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| 0 | Flags locations where the respective Croplands product could not be produced (used in all except **CPFLPCL & CTYCL**). Below an overview of the meaning per layer category:<br>**CTY:** No cropland<br>**CPCST**: Over the three years period this location is not consistently classified as an annual crop.<br>**CPFLP, CPFLD, CPFLDCL**: No fallow land location.<br>**All other CP layers (excluding CPFLPCL)**: No annual cropland |
| 253 | **CPFLPCL**: No fallow land<br>**CTYCL**: No cropland. |
| 255 | Outside area in case of **CTYCL**. |
| 65526 | Fallow land occurrence and hence only fallow land related layers will be generated. The other layers will be flagged with at locations of fallow land (used for all cropping pattern layers, excluding **CPCST, CPFLD, CPFLDCL, CPFLPCL, CPFLP**). |
| 65527 | No delineated field geometry overlaps with an annual cropland location (from **CTY**) and hence no **Cropping Pattern (CP)** layers could be defined (used for all CP layers, excluding **CPCST, CPFLD, CPFLDCL, CPFLPCL, CPFLP).** |
| 65528 | No **CPCST** could be defined for this location. This occurs when the **CTY** has labelled this location in the reference year as a permanent or grassland or fodder crop, whereas in the previous year(s) it was classified as an annual crop (used only for **CPCST** layer). |
| 65529 | It is not possible to derive this specific bare soil period (before or after) since it does not occur within the calendar boundaries of the reference year (used for all **Bare Soil** related layers). |
| 65530 | No secondary crop growing season could be delineated beyond the main growing season delineated for that location (used for all **Secondary Crop** layers). |
| 65531 | There are not enough satellite observations to utilize the emergence and harvest detection algorithm, which is crucial for deriving the cropping pattern layers. Insufficient observations occur when there is a temporal gap of more than 60 days in Sentinel-1 observations or when no Sentinel-2 observations are available after cloud masking, which may occur near bright surfaces (used for all **Cropping Patterns** , except **Fallow Land** related layers and **CPCST**). |
| 65532 | No season delineation is possible based on the output of the emergence and harvest detection algorithms. This can happen under the following situations:<br><br>• No harvest event or emergence event has been detected.<br>• No harvest event does occur after the emergence event.<br>• All the linked season(s) are too long (\>366 days) or too short (\<40 days).<br>• The start of the linked season(s) is after the start of the reference year.<br>• The end of the linked season(s) is before the start of the reference year. <br><br>Used for all **Cropping Pattern** layers, except **Fallow Land** related layers and **CPCST**. |
| 65533 | If the identified growing season(s) has not been flagged by the conditions in flag 65532, and the derived seasonality period extends beyond the defined timeframe for the main growing season, then it is not feasible to produce any Cropping Pattern layer in this situation.<br><br>Used for all **Cropping Pattern** layers, except **Fallow Land** related layers and **CPCST**. |
| 65534 | This flag is utilized when none of the aforementioned flags are already in effect, indicating that no confidence can be calculated for the specific **Cropping Patterns layer**. The confidence assessment for the layers relies on the uncertainty of the satellite time series at the identified emergence and harvest date(s). If the uncertainty is deemed significant or impossible to calculate, this flag will be applied. If this situation happens to derive the confidence level on the harvest date(s), it will impact only those layers that utilized these specific harvest date(s), and similarly for the emergence date(s).<br><br>In case of the **CPFLDCL** layer, this flag could also occur when the **Fallow Land Duration** over the years always entails the full calendar year. As a result, it is not possible to calculate a confidence without information on the confidence at the start or end point defined by a harvest event. Used for all **Cropping Patterns Confidence Layers**. |

# Production quality assessment

The aim of this chapter is to inform about the procedures for internal
validation and accuracy assessment for the status and change layer with
full **EEA38** coverage. While the different layers have their own
quality requirements, all have in common an assessment of the thematic
quality which relies on comparing mapped information within the layers
with reference data at selected locations.

This procedure contains 3 steps that will be described in the following
sections:

-   Sampling design

-   Response design

-   Statistical Analysis

The internal validation of the **HRL Croplands** layers follows
scientifically accepted and operationally proven validation design,
applied in previous productions of various HRL’s of reference years
2012, 2015 and 2018. According to the product specifications, results
will be presented in the form of **Overall Accuracies (OA)**,
**Producer’s** and **User’s Accuracies** or **F-Score measure**.

## Layers to be verified

While the full portfolio of the **HRL Croplands** product includes
numerous layers and reference years, only a subset of them is concerned
by the internal verification exercise. The focus of the assessment has
been set on the primary layer being the **Crop Types** layer and the
reference years 2018 and 2021. The rationale for this selection has been
mainly the availability of essential reference datasets such as
**LUCAS** 2018 \[2\], the VHR IMAGE coverages of 2018 and 2021 imagery,
and publicly available GSAA datasets. An overview of the verified layers
and their target accuracies is given in Table 8-1.

Table 8-1: Layers to be verified and target accuracies

| Layers | Target accuracy |
|------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| Crop Types 10m 2018 | F-score \> 85% at crop group level (6 classes)F-score \> 80% at aggregation level 2 (11 classes) |
| Crop Types10m 2021 | F-score \> 85% at crop group level (6 classes)F-score \> 80% at aggregation level 2 (11 classes) |

## Sampling Design

Two sampling approaches are considered to ensure an adequate accuracy
assessment of the layers at different hierarchical nomenclature levels.

The **first sampling approach** is dedicated to assess the accuracies of
the **Crop Types** layer at crop group level. At pan-European level,
this corresponds to a non-stratified, systematic and random sampling
approach based on the 2 km by 2 km LUCAS grid. For the assessment of
status layers, 10 000 samples (Primary Sampling Units) were randomly
selected over the extended LUCAS grid (Figure 8-1).

![Figure 8-1: Approach I sample distribution for verification at Crop
Group
Level](HRL_Croplands_ProductUserManual_v1.0-media/img-99883cef8420c7c4ac375a7dc59937503e042e5c.png)

The **second sampling approach** is dedicated to the accuracy assessment
of the **Crop Types** layer at aggregation level 1 which contains 11
classes (Table 8-2). To ensure a correct and precise identification of
crop parcels during the verification exercise, the use of LUCAS and GSAA
data as reference data is mandatory. However, some limitations exist
about those datasets:

-   LUCAS survey information exists for the year 2018 but not for the
    year 2021.

-   GSAA data is not openly available for all countries and for all
    reference years.

To circumvent those limitations, the approach II proposes to:

-   For the year 2018, take advantage of the **LUCAS** survey
    information by using all “LUCAS crops” (e.g. LUCAS point with crop
    type information) which were not used as calibration/training data
    for the year 2018 (3226 LUCAS points when excluding **UK**). The
    location of the samples is illustrated in Figure 8-2.

-   Use of **GSAA** data when and where available: per country, a random
    sampling of crop parcels (among those not used for
    calibration/training purposes) is performed to populate the
    reference database. This sampling is done on the year 2021 when GSAA
    was available but can be done on years 2020 or 2019 depending on
    GSAA availability for said country. This is illustrated on Figure
    8-3. The total amount of samples selected from GSAA data is similar
    to the sampling effort for the year 2018 when considering LUCAS crop
    sample (\~ 3300 samples)

![Figure 8-2: Approach II sample distribution depending on LUCAS points
containing crop type information for the year
2018](HRL_Croplands_ProductUserManual_v1.0-media/img-bf239b2bd313dc20cd67520cbf0d4583db937fdf.png)

![Figure 8-3: GSAA data availability, per country per
year](HRL_Croplands_ProductUserManual_v1.0-media/img-790db556d0b7cdc0cdbfdf68b2809cf732973018.png)

It is important to note that those samplings do not cover the whole
EEA38 due to the availability and specifications of GSAA and LUCAS data,
so the reporting levels will differ from approach I.

## Response Design

The response design is the protocol used for retrieval of the
validation/reference information for all sample units. Two types of
datasets are used to perform the interpretation of samples units:
guiding data and reference data.

Guiding data are those used for production of **HRL Croplands** layers
and consist mainly of timeseries of Sentinel data.

Reference data are complementary and independent data that can provide
more spatial details and landscape context:

-   **VHR_IMAGE_2018**[^4] and **VHR_IMAGE_2021**[^5]: very high
    resolution optical earth observation imagery, covering **EEA38** for
    the reference years 2018 and 2021 (+-1 year). Note that at time of
    this exercise, the VHR_IMAGE_2021 coverage is not 100% complete.
    These datasets comprise EO imagery between 2 and 4m spatial
    resolution.

-   Other external datasets:

    -   **Bing maps image**/ cartography layer

    -   **Open Street Map** data

    -   **Google Earth Image** / cartography data

    -   **LUCAS** data for the year 2018 (where available)

    -   **GSAA** data for the year 2018 and 2021 (where available)

The interpretation workflow for the verification of the crop group
consists of thematic plausibility analysis of the sample units.
Plausibility analysis means that the class assigned by the layer is
known by the interpreter during the interpretation. The Primary Sampling
Units were interpreted at the crop group level (Table 8-2) using guiding
and reference datasets, considering the surrounding of the sample
(typically crop parcel) to properly account for the MMU of 0.25 ha.

| 3100 | Arable Crops | Unclassified arable crop | Unclassified arable crop | Unclassified arable crop |
| 3200 | Permanent Crops | Unclassified permanent crop | Unclassified permanent crop | Unclassified permanent crop |

For layers where the second sampling design has been applied (see 8.2)
and the use of **LUCAS** and **GSAA** data were used, the response
design is simplified. No visual interpretation is required as the
reference class is extracted from LUCAS/GSAA data to be compared to the
**Crop Types** layer without any additional process.

## Statistical Analysis

The thematic accuracy level or the **Crop Types** layer is defined in
terms of F-score, which can be derived from confusion matrices. To this
end, the row and column totals and the diagonal of the matrix are used
to assess two further types of accuracy, the User’s and Producer’s
Accuracy:

-   **Producer’s Accuracy (PA)** for a given class =
    $$\alpha\alpha/C\alpha$$, representing an (inversely proportional)
    measure of Omission Error. For instance, an observation has been
    identified as tree-covered in the validation dataset but was
    actually classified as another class: it has been omitted from the
    target class.

-   **User’s Accuracy (UA)** for a given class =
    $$\alpha\alpha/R\alpha$$, representing an (inversely proportional)
    measure of the Commission Error (or contamination risk), i.e. errors
    due to the wrong allocation of an observation (i.e. mapped
    landcover) to a landcover class. For instance, an observation is
    classified as broadleaved tree cover, but identified as belonging to
    another class during the validation process: this observation has
    contaminated another class.

F-score is a measure of accuracy calculated as the harmonic mean of the
Producer’s and the User’s Accuracies calculated as:

$$
F_1=2.\frac{(P A\,.U A)}{(P A+U A)}
$$

For both **Crop Types** layers 2018 and 2021 the F1 scores are computed
derived for each class of crop group level (6 classes) and aggregation
level 1 (11 classes) (Table 8-2).

## Verification Results

The assessed accuracies for the **Crop Types** layers are presented at
the crop group level (gridbased random sampling) and the aggregation
level 1 (11 classes, opportunistic sampling from LUCAS and GSAA data).
For the rationale on the different sampling designs please refer to
section 8.2)

### Crop Group level

Accuracy figures for crop group level are presented in the confusion
matrices shown for the EU27 in Table 8-4 and the EEA38 in Table 8-5

At the crop group level the layers should reach an F1-score of 85% for
each class. This is the case for all classes for both reference years
2018 and 2021 at EU27 level, even crop types which present a lower
number of samples such as root/tuber or dry pulses and vegetables. At
EEA38 level, the results are similar with the exception of permanent
crops class that reach accuracies slightly below the 85% threshold
(83-84%).

| Class code | Crop Group                     |
|------------|--------------------------------|
| 11         | Cereals                        |
| 12         | Dry pulses & Vegetables        |

### Aggregation level 1

Accuracy figures for Crop Types layers at Aggregation Level 1 are
presented in Table 8-6 below, according to the comparisons with LUCAS
and GSSA data.

Target accuracy for this level of analysis is an F-Score of 80% for each
of the classes. While some crop types exceed the 80% threshold (cereals,
maize, rapeseed), other fail to reach it. The rarity of some classes
explains the few numbers of samples concerned and therefore can imply
that lower F-score should be taken with caution (flax, cotton, hemp,
soybean, and rice classes). Unclassified classes have a null F-score due
to their nature, as those classes do not exist in the LUCAS or GSAA
reference dataset.
