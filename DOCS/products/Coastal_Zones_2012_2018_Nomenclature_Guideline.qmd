# Introduction

This document provides a **comprehensive Land Cover/Land Use nomenclature guideline for the Copernicus local land monitoring product Coastal Zones**, which is covering the detailed description of all level 5 classes, their geographic characteristics, available input datasets and relevant methods to interpret the respective classes.

# LC/LU Product Description

The Coastal Zones Land Cover/Land Use product is providing a detailed LC/LU dataset for areas along the marine coastline of the EEA39 countries. A 10 km inland buffer zone and the CLC (Corine Land Cover) buffer zone seawards along the coastline define the Area of Interest (AoI) of the CZ mapping. In the first project phase the AoI was amended to include all areas relevant for the Coastal Zones product (estuaries, coastal lowlands, nature reserves). The total covered area on land along all European coastline is approximately 715.000 km².

The CZ component contains 3 complementary service elements:

a)  LC/LU status maps for the reference year 2012

b)  LC/LU status maps for the reference year 2018

c)  LC/LU change layer 2012-2018 derived from and fully consistent with a) and b) to characterize the evolution of the coastline over time

The Coastal Zones LC/LU layer differentiates 71 thematic LC/LU classes. The layers are based on satellite image classification to derive the 2012 and 2018 LC/LU situation. A key element is a visual interpretation and delineation of LC/LU from VHR satellite imagery for the reference years 2012 and 2018.

The change detection layer makes use of the LC/LU 2012 status information, applying a visual change interpretation and delineation using the VHR satellite imagery from the reference years 2012 and 2018.

The nomenclature is designed based on the MAES ecosystem typology, as part of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020. Furthermore, this LC/LU nomenclature ensures compatibility to other European established LC/LU products such as CLC and Urban Atlas as well as Riparian Zones and Natura2000 to a high degree.

Compared to the last two products the nomenclature experienced some adaptations to reduce ambiguities and to reflect the particularities of coastal zones better.

# Coastal Zones LC/LU Nomenclature 

The nomenclature of the CZ products follows the same approach as the other hotspot nomenclatures. All thematic hotspot nomenclatures share a set of core classes in common. Building on this basis each hotspot product is amended with additionally detailing classes required by the topic of the specific product. The LC/LU classes and the hierarchical structure of the nomenclature are conceived in a way to allow the merging of different hotspot products to one at the level of the core classes. The current CZ nomenclature is the result of two revisions. The first revision was introduced in summer 2017 and aimed at:

- Harmonisation within the thematic hotspot mapping products

- Reduction of classes to those reliably derivable from EO data

- Removal of thematic overlaps and gaps

- Harmonisation of hierarchical inconsistencies

The second revision was introduced in late 2019 after extensive discussions with mapping experts and CZ product users. The second revision aimed at the further harmonisation of the nomenclature and to maximise the usefulness of the product for the user community. At the current stage (Q1-2020) the second revision is only implemented by the CZ product, not by the other thematic hotspot products yet. The translation from the 2017 version into the 2019 version is a matter of class recoding, thus consistency is preserved.

The creation of the new Natura 2000 nomenclature, based on the v1 of this guideline, experienced a coding inconsistency due to which an extension of the CZ Nomenclature to include a level 5 was decided to guarantee harmonisation between the products. With this novelty, the updated CZ nomenclature and the Natura 2000 nomenclature are identical until Level 2 and only vary in an extended subdivision of parent classes on level 4 or 5.

In line with the other thematic hotspot products the CZ nomenclature is designed to address the MAES classes at level 2.[^1] Table 2 describes how CZ classes shall be aggregated to map MAES at level 2.

# Mapping Rules

**Object Delineation:**

Object delineation is performed on VHR EO data (see Table 1) as primary data source. In areas, where two or more satellite scenes overlap, the most suitable scene is chosen as primary data source. In this regard a detailed prioritization system has been established considering especially acquisition year and acquisition month.

In cases where clouds or cloud shadows cover the area of interest alternative image data can be used. Low resolution images (e.g. Sentinel-2) can mitigate gaps according to land cover type (e.g. small gaps due to clouds on big forest coverage can be mitigated by low resolution images).

**Delineation Rules:**

Object delineation should be as follows:

- Delineation shall be angular and not round.

- Avoid digitizing too many vertices: Use vertices as few as possible and only as many as necessary to define the shape of an object.

- Avoid mapping sharp angles.

- Use road centres (roads \< 10m width) as border between two objects if roads separate two features. E.g. a forest and an agricultural area are separated by a road feature \< 10m width. Map the border between forest and agriculture in the middle of the road.

**Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) / Minimum Mapping Width (MMW):**

The minimum mapping unit defined is ≥ 0.5 ha for all objects. A minimum width of ≥ 10m is required for all features.

[MMU Exceptions:]{.underline}

- Objects located at the border of the Area of Interest:

If an object is cut by the AoI border and the portion lying inside the AoI therefore is \< 0.5 ha, this feature is mapped, if the whole object (inside and outside the AoI) amounts to ≥ 0.5 ha. However, the MMU of those divided features lying inside the AoI shall have a MMU of at least ≥ 0.1 ha. Smaller objects will be generalized.

- Linear features (roads, railways, rivers) that are split in two or more polygons by other linear elements (e.g. the road/railway network) will be mapped even if the resulting segments are smaller than the MMU in order to preserve the network. However, features \< 0.1 ha will be generalized.

- Urban objects which are confined by roads or railways. Features \< 0.25 ha will be generalized.

- Complex changes (see below).

[MMW Exceptions:]{.underline}

- To maintain continuity of linear features (Codes 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 8.1.1 and 8.1.2); the MMW may fall below the limit of 10 m over a distance of up to 100m.

**Good Practice for Data Display -- Mapping Scale:**

On-screen mapping scale is 1:5.000-1:10.000 depending on the landscape and feature class. Large homogeneous objects like agricultural areas or woodland are mapped at scales 1:8.000-1:10.000. For all other features, 1:5.000 mapping scale is applied.

**Overlap Rules:**

Objects may not overlap. In case of real objects overlay, the following rules apply:

- If objects overlap on **different levels**, the top level is mapped. Example: if an artificial canal overlaps a river, the canal is mapped continuously.

- If objects overlap on **the same level**, the visually dominant object is mapped continuously. However, if roads and railways meet on the same level, railways are mapped continuously to maintain the railway network.

**Priority Rules:**

The priority rules applied are defined as follows:

- Objects \< 0.5 ha are added to the neighbouring object of the same sub-class.

- Objects \< 0.5 ha are added to the neighbouring object with the longest common border line. Exception: Objects surrounded by railways or roads. If an object is below the MMU size and completely surrounded by a road or railway network, it shall be aggregated with that surrounding traffic line. However, an exception is made for urban objects. Please see respective definition with classes *1 Urban.*

**Water level rules**

Differences due to different water levels are not considered as a land cover / land use change. The reference year 2012 serves as basis for the LC/LU mapping and the water level of 2012 will be delineated. If there are temporal fluctuations of water level between 2012 and 2018 following procedures will be applied:

- **Flood event:**

A flood event is an exceptional situation and not considered as a \"Different water level\". In case of a flood event the actual/real LC/LU should be mapped (use EU Hydro, OSM or adequate data sources for identification). In those cases no comment \"Different water level\" but "Flooded area" will be allocated.

- **Higher water level in 2012:**

In case of a higher water level in 2012, the water level of 2012 will be mapped, and the temporal dried up areas in 2018 will not be mapped. The water areas will be flagged with the comment \"Different water level\".

- **Higher water level in 2018:**

In case of a higher water level in 2018, the water level of 2012 will be mapped. The areas covered by water in 2018 get mapped with the actual land cover of 2012 and get attributed with the comment \"Different water level\"

- **Different water level on coastline**

The coastline is derived from the adapted product of the EU-Hydro coastline. This coastline will not be changed even if the imagery shows different water level. In the case of different water levels due to tides the polygons should get the comment \"Different water level\".

- Flagging of polygons due to different water level should just be applied if the MMW and MMU specifications are met, the difference should be lager then 0,5 ha and wider than 10m.

**Geometric inconsistencies between 2012 and 2018**

Sometimes geometric inconsistencies between 2012 and 2018 can be seen on image data. In this case the delineation will be performed as follows:

- 2012 LC/LU will be mapped according to image geometries (2012 is base geometry).

- 2018 LC/LU will not be changed due to image distortion. In case of real LC/LU changes these will be "interpolated" based on the 2012 image geometries.

**Application of Additional Data Sources:**

For data interpretation, additional data sources like CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2012/2018, Urban Atlas (UA) 2012/2018, Riparian Zones mapping (RZ) 2012/2018, Natura2000 mapping (N2K) 2012, topographic maps, national WMS services, COTS navigation data and auxiliary data including local expertise is used.

- RZ and N2k: existing Hot Spot Mappings are fully integrated in the CZ dataset.

- UA2012/2018: UA data are partly integrated in the CZ dataset. Suitable classes are selected and after adaptation of geometries integrated in the CZ dataset.

- CLC2012/2018: CLC is used as important data source for class assignment. CLC data use ensures data compatibility between CLC and CZ.

- In-situ data: Diverse national in-situ data like WMS services, specific maps or classifications as well as descriptions and maps of N2000 or RAMSAR sites are used to support the object interpretation.

**Allowed Comments:**

In order to clarify certain mapping delineations, there are some comments defined as product attributes.

  1              Polygons \< 0.5 ha at outer AoI site boundary, that have an apparent continuation outside the AoI boundary visible on the image data.                                                                                                                                   \"Area size exception (at Coastal Zones AoI boundary)\"

  2              Polygons \< 0.5 ha inside AoI site boundary; e.g. to ensure continuity of road/rail/river network at intersections of these classes. Urban objects confined by roads or railways ≥ 0.25 ha up to \< 0.5 ha.                                                             \"Area size exception (inside Coastal Zones AoI boundary)\"

# Definition and rules for change mapping

Following definitions and rules for Land Cover Change (LCC) mapping are based on the LCC rules of Corine Land Cover (CLC). The given rules were adopted and expanded to the Natura 2000, Riparian Zone and Coastal Zones specifications and requirements.

## V.I Mapping of Land Cover Change in Coastal Zones project

In the Coastal Zones project, change mapping is carried out by visual interpretation of 2012 LC/LU vector data and satellite imagery of the timeframe 2018 and subsequent direct delineation of change polygons.

The basis of identification of changes is the interpretation of detectable land cover differences on satellite images from 2012 and 2018. The use of ancillary data is recommended.

Interpreters must be aware that not every change visible on the images should be treated as changes, e.g.:

- transient phenomena such as floods and temporary water-logging;

- seasonal changes in natural vegetation;

- seasonal changes in agriculture, such as effects of crop rotation on arable land;

- forest plantation growth, still not reaching the height and/or canopy closure of forest;

- changes of water level;

- temporal changes in water cover of fishpond cassettes being part of their management;

- seasonal changes of snow spots in high mountains.

- ...

The introduction of false changes must also be avoided. Many of these can and should be excluded by pure logics. These vary from country to country (e.g. while normally sea water does not change into pasture, it might happen in the Netherlands), thus following examples are not exhaustive and not binding for all cases. However, in most cases they can be considered valid.

Highly improbable changes are for example (not a complete list):

- Classes *1.1.1 Urban fabric (predominantly public and private units)* 🡪 any other class than urban: urban areas seldom disappear.

- Classes *5 Heathland and scrub* 🡪 3.x.1.0: bushy vegetation classes of different climatic zones do not change between each other.

- *8.1.2 Highly modified natural water courses* 🡪 any other class: highly modified natural water courses and canals do not change to another class.

- etc.

**Minimum Mapping Unit and Minimum Mapping Width for changes**

The Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) for LCC was set to ≥0.5 ha.

The Minimum Mapping Width (MMW) of ≥10 m is also valid for the LCC polygons.

**Exceptions** from MMU are defined where a generalization of change objects \< 0.5 ha is not reasonable because it would discard valuable information:

- Simple Change: Changes located at the border of a CZ AoI that continue outside, forming together objects of ≥ 0.5 ha. Those polygons will have the common attribute that is given for objects cut by CZ border. Objects \< 0.05 ha will be generalized.

- Complex Change: When a LCC polygon ≥ 0.5 ha is formed by several polygons, also polygons \< 0.5 ha have to be considered. See also 0. Complex changes. As the minimum mapping size for single change polygons of complex changes 0.05 ha is proposed.

- Single changes \< 0.05 ha will be generalized.

Land Cover Changes are changes that occur between the timespan 2012 (+/- 2 years) and the timespan 2018 (+/- 1 year). Changes resulting from different interpretations of the same subject are not considered as change.

**Direct delineation of changes**

Change polygons are drawn directly over the corresponding image by visual interpretation and are not generated automatically by a GIS operation.

## V.II Simple change 

Simple changes are modifications where either a single polygon changes from one LC/LU class to another or a new polygon ≥ 0.5 ha emerges within an existing, larger polygon.

![Figure 1: The loss of green urban area ≥ 0.5 ha (1.4) in 2012 by becoming urban fabric in 2018.](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image8.png)

## V.III Complex changes 

Although the MMU for change mapping is 0.5 ha, in some cases change polygons \< 0.5 ha are also mapped. When a new polygon is formed by taking area from several other polygons (e.g. a road construction, urban growth, ...), the individually connected change parts can be mapped even if they are \< 0.5 ha, given they altogether make up a ≥ 0.5 ha complex change polygon (shown in Figure 2).

The minimum mapping unit for single polygons of complex changes is: ≥ 0.05 ha

![Figure 2: Urban expansion: Changes with MMU \< 0.5 ha make up a complex change area of 0.5 ha.](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image9.png)

Explanation of shown figure: In 2018 urban area (1.1.1.1) has taken 0.1 ha from managed grassland (4.1) and 0.4 ha from arable land (2.1.1). That means in 2018 we have one single class and in 2012 two different classes \<0.5ha. These two changes make up a complex change area of 0.5 ha.

Complex changes have to have a common attribute ("splitted change") in 2012 and in 2018 and must make up altogether ≥ 0.5 ha.

**Every mapped complex change should result in a correct status mapping of 2012 and 2018. The derived status maps need to fulfil the mapping specifications, especially the Minimum Mapping Unit of 0.5 ha.** If all polygons are dissolved by their 2012 level 5 code no object should have an area \<0.5 ha (the same applies for 2018 respectively). If this can\'t be guaranteed the single change parts need to be generalized.

![Figure 3: Urban expansion: Changes with MMU \< 0.5 ha make up a complex change area of 0.5 ha, but because the single changes would result in an incorrect status map 2018 they are generalized to one class.](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image10.png)

### V.III.II Handling changes in, by-definition, change classes --- changes at landscape level

CZ nomenclature includes some land cover classes that, by definition, are characterized by a land cover change. These classes are:

- 1.3.1.1 Mineral extraction sites

- 1.3.1.2 Dump sites

- 1.3.1.3 Construction sites

- 1.3.2 Land without current use

- 3.4 Transitional woodland and scrub

If a construction site in 2012 is visible, a new construction, mainly urban, is likely to be visible in 2018 as well. If a construction site in 2018 is visible, another former land use, is likely to be visible in 2012.

Transitional woodland indicates that a regrowth of forest should appear from 2012 to 2018 or deforestation between 2012 and 2018 (exception possible). {{< pagebreak >}}

Permanent crops are differentiated between low stem plantations of fruit trees and berries including vineyards on one side and olive groves on the other. The mixed class of "heterogeneous agricultural areas" distinguishes between certain agricultural practices ("Annual crops associated with permanent crops", "Agro-forestry") and the amount of natural vegetation on those areas ("Complex cultivation patterns", "Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation"). |

: Table 4: High level description of the CZ LC/LU nomenclature

The nomenclature of the Coastal Zone mapping is based on a five-digit system representing the thematic *Levels 1 - 5*. *Level 1* represents the highest rank in the hierarchical system and is the most generic level. Each of the 8 *Level 1* parent classes is further subdivided into sub classes (or child classes) one or several more times representing the *Levels 2 - 5*. For consistency purposes in the mapping data, classes ending on *Levels 2 - 4* are filled up with \"0\" if they are not further subdivided, so every class has a five-digit code on *Level 5* (e.g. \"*2.1.1.0.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land*\").

**Important Note:**

For better reading of this guideline, no \"0\" are displayed in the codes resulting in a different number of digits of codes of the most specific child class.

In order to better distinguish between a parent class (on any hierarchical level) and the last child class, parent classes are referred to as e.g. \"classes 6.2.1 Beaches and dunes\" indicating that all child classes within this parent class are addressed. {{< pagebreak >}}

# 1 Urban{.unnumbered}

![](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image11.png)

The urban classes contain land that is covered by building structures and transport network. Urban fabrics appear in blue and darkish blue-grey on satellite images.

The establishment of the boundary between continuous, dense and low-density urban fabric can be difficult to delimit. The main aspects to determine these classes are either by the presence and quantity of vegetation, or by the use of the IM.D HRL.

From the UA Mapping Guide:

- Surfaces with dominant human influence but without agricultural land use. These areas include all artificial structures and their associated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces.

- Artificial structures are defined as buildings, roads, all constructions of infrastructure and other artificially sealed or paved areas.

- Associated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces are areas functionally related to human activities, except agriculture.

- Also, the areas where the natural surface is replaced by extraction and/or deposition or designed landscapes (such as urban parks or leisure parks) are mapped in this class.

- The land use is dominated by permanent population.

Specific generalization/delineation rules are applied for urban classes:

- Segments of roads, rivers and railways \< 0.5 ha, that are necessary to represent the "network" of each feature will be mapped. Features \< 0.1 ha will be generalized.

- Urban objects confined by roads or railways ≥ 0.25 up to \< 0.5ha. Smaller urban objects will be generalized.

- If an infrastructure line is crossing a river, the bridge has to be mapped if the bridge is wider than 10 meters.

- Specific generalization rules are applied to *1.1.1.3 Low density fabric (IM.D \<30%)*, (see description of the specific class).

**MMU exceptions:**

- Exceptions from MMU \>0.5 ha are made for "*1.2.1 Road networks and associated land"* and "*1.2.2 Railways and associated land*" in order to keep the network formed by these linear features (always with 0.1 ha \< MMU \< 0.5 ha).

- Further exception is all urban elements being encircled by rails, roads or rivers. In those cases, urban features up to a MMU of 0.25 ha are kept and flagged with comments ("Area size exception").

**MMW exceptions:**

- To maintain continuity of linear features (1.2.1 / 1.2.2 / 8.1.1 / 8.1.2), the MMW may fall below the limit of 10 m over a distance of up to 100 m.

**Methodological advice:**

- If local in-situ data other than UA available, use if suitable.

- IM.D HRL has to be used outside UA Core, for delineation support.

- For interpretation of urban density: Use IM.D HRL.

[Generalisation rules:]{.underline}

If a strict MMU \>0.5 ha mapping of *1.1.1.3 Low density fabric (IMD \<30%)* is applied, the low urban density areas would be underestimated. Therefore, to get a good representation of the area, the following generalisation rules will be adopted:

- Do not apply the 10 m MMW distance rule at the urban fringe but apply a \< 50m MMW to generalize outline.

- Include private gardens.

- Avoid mapping of single urban segments.

- Map the "whole structure".

- Close gaps at the urban fringe applying a maximum width of 50 m.

In any case, real agricultural/grassland parcel contained within urban surroundings, will be mapped as agricultural/grassland.

**1.1.2.1 Industrial, commercial, public and military units (other)**

**Definition:**

This category contains Industrial, commercial, public and military units. Included in this class are also all kinds of energy producing facilities except nuclear energy plants. The administrative border and associated areas, such as roads, sealed areas and vegetated areas are included, if these areas are below the MMU. It also contains public, military and private services.

At least 30% of the ground is covered by artificial surfaces. More than 50% of those artificial surfaces are occupied by buildings and/or artificial structures with non-residential use, i.e. industrial, commercial or carriage related uses are dominant.

The texture is homogenous with large buildings, car parks and sheds representing industrial or commercial complexes. Industrial or commercial units located in urban fabric are only taken into account if they are clearly distinguishable from residential areas.

**Methodological advice:**

- If local in-situ data other than UA available, use if suitable.

- Use COTS transport infrastructure data.

- Roads will be used from COTS navigation systems, where available. In case of geometrical differences between EO data and COTS navigation data, the COTS navigation data has to be corrected in line with the EO data.

- Roads do not necessarily have to form a closed network. Isolated traffic lines are possible, but they have to be mapped with regard to the MMU criterion.

- Associated land \< 0.5 ha MMU is mapped with the roads as it is visible in the EO data and topographic maps.

- If a road is covered by a tunnel, the LU/LC over the tunnel has to be mapped.

- Railways always form the top-level. They clip all other features.

- Minimum mapping width \>=10m.

- If a railway is covered by a tunnel, the LU/LC over the tunnel has to be mapped.

[Generalisation rules:]{.underline}

Secondary railway lines within urban context have to be mapped if they are visible in the images or if they can be supported by ancillary data.

In industrial sites, rail networks are often complicated and hard to delineate in SPOT5/6 if no ancillary data are available. If no auxiliary data are available, map only those railroad features that can be detected with SPOT5/6 data.

**1.2.3.1 Cargo port**

**Definition:**

This class comprises container terminals with special infrastructure to load and unload cargo to and from ships, as well as move and store container on the harbour site. Included are storage areas, lifting devices, containers and quays. Oil and gas terminals adjacent or connected to a port site are also included. Industrial facilities may be situated next to cargo ports. The port delineation only comprises the storage areas for cargo (container, gas and oil tanks, open air coal storage). Areas and facilities for processing goods are considered industrial areas. Cargo ports are usually well connected to major transport infrastructure and often have access to a railway line.

Distinguishable to other port types by large container ships, storage facilities and connection to transport infrastructure. Ships on the water surface are included in the water body.

As many industrial sites at the coast have their own loading facilities, caution should be taken when delineating port areas and the adjoining industrial sites. If a site is primarily used for storage it should be included in the port areas, otherwise, e.g. if production sites are visible, it should be mapped as 1.1.2.1 Industrial, commercial, public and military units (other).

**1.2.3.2 Passenger port**

**Definition:**

Public port specialized on transportation of people. Infrastructure includes quays, piers, passenger terminals and large car parks. At passenger ports with car ferries, a large open area for the temporary parking of cars may be available. Also, facilities to restock the supplies of passenger ferries and cruise ships may be visible.

Distinguishable to other port types by ferries of different size including car ferries and the associated infrastructure on land like large passenger terminal buildings. Ships on the water surface are included in the water body.

Passenger ports are often enclosed by fencing and only accessible through main gateways.

Passenger ports are often part of a greater port area in combination with a cargo port and/or a marina.

**1.2.3.4 Naval port**

**Definition:**

Often in natural bay situations and next to public ports. For loading and unloading heavy military machinery stable and broad piers are needed. Piers and jetties are longer than at other port types since naval ships are large in size.

Naval ships might be visible on water as well as military vehicles on the harbour site. Delineation is according to the fencing of the military area.

Naval port areas contain the infrastructure of the port area, arsenals, heliports and barracks. Quays, piers and the transport and storage area associated to the port are included in this class. Submarine harbours are considered as naval ports.

**1.2.3.6 Local multi-functional harbours**

**Definition:**

Small scale harbour with different purposes and without major economic significance. Often more integrated in an urban area without clearly visible delineation. As a consequence, the delineation is less strict and includes also the nearby area that is influenced by the harbour atmosphere like buildings facing the harbour front, promenades, green urban areas and places to sojourn. If boats in the harbour basin are in a densely parked situation like in marinas, the affected water area is included in the harbour area.

Port areas contain the infrastructure of the port area. Quays, piers as well as the transport and storage area associated to the port are included in this class.

**1.2.3.7 Shipyards**

**Definition:**

Shipyards have an increased environmental impact on the adjoining water bodies. Through welding, painting and sandblasting water may be contaminated. Ship breaking can release toxic materials which may be washed away.

Large shipyards contain dry docks, specialised cranes, slipways, painting facilities and large areas and/or buildings for construction of ships.

Their location is often near harbour sites or industrial areas and may have their independent loading/unloading station for materials needed for ship construction. Associated land like administrative buildings and car parks for employees are included. If the area is fenced, delineate along the fencing.

Separation between shipyards and harbour sites may be difficult. Use fencing or roads if possible and useful.

**Definition:**

This class includes public and industrial dump sites.

Dump sites are often located near large towns or major industrial areas. Sites being in use or only recently abandoned, with no trace of vegetation, are comprised. Associated land, buildings and infrastructures are included.

Landfills may be confused with extraction site since their surface is mostly bare soil. Landfills usually don't have heavy machinery on-site other than trucks delivering trash. In most cases landfills have a flat open ground with staircase structure since trash is deposited in several layers and each time gets buried under soil.

Dump sites may look similar to industrial sites with large areas where waste can be stored in order to be recycled.

# 2 Cropland{.unnumbered} 

![](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/Picture1.png){width=20%}

Cropland is the main food production area. It includes both, intensively managed ecosystems and multifunctional areas supporting many semi-natural and natural species along with food production (lower intensity management). It comprises regularly or recently cultivated agricultural, horticultural and domestic habitats and agro-ecosystems with significant coverage of natural vegetation (agricultural mosaics)[^2].

Croplands is categorised in three main groups:

- Arable land

- Permanent crops

- Heterogeneous agricultural areas

**Arable land** is land under a rotation system used for annually harvested plants and fallow lands. The land is permanently or not irrigated. It includes cereals, oil seed plants, vegetables, beets, fodder and flooded crops such as rice and other inundated croplands.

**Permanent crops** are surfaces that are not under a rotation system but last for many seasons and need not to be replanted after harvest. Included are ligneous crops of standard cultures for fruit production such as extensive fruit orchards, olive groves, chestnut groves, walnut groves, shrub orchards such as vineyards and some specific low-system orchard plantation, espaliers and climbers. In the case of irrigated permanent crops, the qualification of irrigation prevails over permanent, thus, all the irrigated permanent crops are classified as *2.1.1 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land*.

**Heterogeneous agricultural areas** comprise surfaces where several categories are mixed. This may be either annual crops associated with permanent crops on the same parcel or annual crops cultivated under forest trees. Moreover, also combinations of annual crops, meadows and/or permanent crops mixed with natural vegetation or natural areas belong to this class.

Specific decision rules have been stabilised to distinct different types of heterogeneous agricultural areas:

- Annual crops associated or in mosaic with permanent crops (vineyards, olives groves and non-irrigated fruits trees) in parcels \< 0.5 has. →*2.3.1 Annual crops associated with permanent crops*.

- Mosaic or association of arable land and permanent crops in parcels \< 0.5 has. →*2.3.2 Complex cultivation patterns*.

- Mix of arable land and pastures → *2.3.2 Complex cultivation patterns.*

- Crops (annual/permanent/irrigated/non-irrigated) and mosaic of crops and pastures in mosaic or invaded by natural vegetation (agricultural area \> 75% and presence of parcels) → *2.3.3 Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation.*

- Agro-forestry landscapes in specific locations → *2.3.4 Agro-forestry*.

***This category includes:***

- **2.1 Arable land**

  - 2.1.1 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land

  - 2.1.2 Greenhouses

**Methodological advice:**

- **Traditional irrigated land with permanent infrastructures**:

  - Extraction or irrigated land based on spectral signature of summer-time imagery.

  - Delineation of permanent irrigable land.
  
  - Non-irrigated land in the date of the image, fallow land and parcels presumably irrigated in springtime within irrigable areas are included in *2.1.1 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land.*

![Example of final result of classification of traditional irrigated land with traditional infrastructures](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image120.png)

- **Irrigated land using underground water**:

  - Extraction or irrigated land based on spectral signature of summer-time imagery of use of series of images (as Landsat).
  
  - Parcels with the accurate spectral signature and \> 0.5 ha will be considered as *2.1.1 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land*.
  
  - Only it will be considered parcels irrigated at the date of the image. If summer-time imagery are not available Landsat time series will be used.
  
![Example of final result of classification of irrigated land using underground water](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image121.png)

- **Centre pivot irrigation systems**

  - These types of irrigated landscapes are considered in the same way that other areas irrigated by underground water.
  
  - Extraction or irrigated land based on spectral signature of summer-time imagery.
  
  - Parcels with the accurate spectral signature and \> 0.5 ha will be considered as *2.1.1 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land*.

[Distinction irrigated/non-irrigated land in Mediterranean region:]{.underline}

In order to extract irrigated areas in Mediterranean region, the use of time series images is essential: irrigated areas are characterized by red colours in infrared combinations bands in summer time, meanwhile, at the same time, non-irrigated parcels have not vegetation.

- When using only one acquisition date image, irrigated areas can be often dismissed. Further assessment and revision will be required.

- CORE03 and Landsat series will be used.

- The reference year for the time series selection must be the most frequent year on the CORE03 product.

- Both irrigated and non-irrigated area delimitation should be performed through CORE03 product, while time series Landsat images must be considered to assign the appropriate category (*2.1.1*).

In this landscape the understory is regularly cleared of scrubs to improve grasslands or trees.

In agroforestry areas with T.C.D. \< 30% it is frequent the presence of arable land.

Agro-forestry areas with more than 50% of scrub understory are considered as forest.

Agro-forestry areas (grassland understory) with less than 10% T.C.D. are considered as grassland.

# 3 Woodland and forest{.unnumbered}

![](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/picture4.png)

The woodland and forest classes are mainly dominated by woody vegetation of various ages or by succession of climax vegetation types[^3]. The interpretation is done according to FAO (2000) with tree cover \>10%, MMU of 0.5 ha and trees able to reach 5 m height in-situ at maturity. Young natural stands and all plantations established for forestry purposes, which have yet to reach a crown density of 10% or tree height of 5 m, are also included as forest. These areas normally are part of the forest area although temporarily small in height because of human intervention or natural reasons but which are expected to revert to forest.

Forest further comprises:

- Nurseries and seed orchards that constitute an integral part of the forest;

- Forest roads;

- Cleared tracts \< 0.5 ha;

- Firebreaks and other small open areas \< 0.5 ha;

- Forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas with an area of more than 0.5 ha and width of more than 10 m (which goes beyond the FAO Forest definition of 20 m);

- Plantations primarily used for forestry purposes, including rubber wood plantations and cork oak stands.

Land predominantly used for agricultural practices is excluded. Excluded is also land with:

- Either a crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of 5-10% of trees able to reach a height of 5m at maturity in situ;

- A crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than 10% of trees not able to reach a height of 5m at maturity in situ (e.g. dwarf or stunted trees);

- Shrub or bush cover of more than 10 percent is not accounted as forest.

The differentiation between broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest is in accordance with CLC interpretation guideline and HR Forest definition.

**Broadleaved forest:** Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where broadleaved species predominate and represent more than 75% of the pattern.

**Coniferous forest:** Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where coniferous species predominate and represent more than 75% of the pattern.

**Mixed forest:** Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where neither broadleaved nor coniferous species predominate. The share of coniferous or broad-leaved species does not exceed 75% in the canopy closure.

The definition of Woodland and Forest is mainly oriented along aggregated EUNIS habitat classes.

Forest type interpretation might be problematic in locations with sunny slopes or in hilly regions with shady slopes.

Fire breaks will be classified according to their current land covers.

**3.6 Damaged forest**

**Definition:**

Damaged forest includes areas still visible in the satellite image e.g. spectrally due to discoloration of needles and leaves or trees lying on the ground. Either pests, storm or tornado events or snow and ice damage may have caused the forest damage.

In most cases, the damage affects monocultures, as these are more vulnerable than mixed forests. Severe bark-beetle attacks, however, are most evident in national parks, as the park regulations do not allow counteractions that may confine the damage.

Forest damaged by fire will mainly occur in Southern Europe where wildfires are a common phenomenon. In Central Europe forest fires are rare and occur only sometimes during very hot and dry summers on south-facing slopes.

# 4 Grassland{.unnumbered}

![](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/Picture3.png)

The grassland classes are areas dominated by grassy vegetation of two kinds --managed pastures and (semi-) natural (extensively managed) grasslands[^4]. Generally, grasses (basically *g[raminacea]{.underline}* plants but can include tall forbs, rushes and sedges, mosses and lichens) covers more than 30% of the soils (EUNIS description), called below Crown Cover Density (C.C.D.).

According to Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive, European natural grasslands are limited to alpine meadows (as Alpine, Pyrenean and Oro-Iberian grasslands) and other located grasslands.

In this sense, level 2 natural grasslands are considered as natural and semi-natural grasslands and managed grasslands are agricultural grasslands. The main characteristics of agricultural grassland are the high human influence, basically cultivation and visible parcel structure in EO data.

Semi-natural grasslands are frequently associated with trees and scrubs. These grasslands should be managed to maintain their grass coverage, basically by cutting out scrubs manually or mechanically. The combination of trees and grasslands is also present in many locations in Europe (in alluvial areas; in wooded hay meadows; due forest clearing, etc.). *Dehesas* and other wooded pastures, as *Fennoscandinavian wooded pastures,* are included in Cropland class (agroforestry systems located in South Western Europe) or woodland and forest (in the case of forest pastures)*.*

***This category includes:***

- **4.1 Managed grassland**

- **4.2 Natural & semi-natural grassland**

  - 4.2.1 Semi-natural grassland

  - 4.2.2 Alpine and sub-alpine natural grassland  {{< pagebreak >}}

**4.1 Managed grassland**

**Definition:**

Managed grasslands are considered intensively managed areas for the production of grass. From a land use point of view, in the case of these agricultural grasslands, grass is a crop in the same way as cereals or others. Managed grasslands could be divided into improved and semi-improved grasslands according to their management.

Agricultural grasslands occupy huge areas in the lowlands of the European plain and in United Kingdom and Ireland, where they have a longer growing season due to climatic conditions, leaving dryer areas for arable crops. In many areas, arable land and agricultural grasslands are mixed.

This category corresponds to 231 Corine class (Pastures). According to the statistical analysis of Corine Land Cover 2006 data, pastures (231 classes) occupied 66% of more than 60.000.000 ha considered as grasslands (classes 231-pastures- and 321 --natural grasslands-).

The main characteristics of an ideally improved agricultural grassland farmland are [^5]

- The grass farmland is dominated by selected grasses, especially perennial, and the crop is very dense. In early spring, the grassland is often fertilized by the farmer. These grass farmland areas are chlorophyll rich almost all year long and do not contain or contain very little dead biomass.

- Intensive cutting and grazing is done during the grass growing season (usually from April to September).

- The grass could be cut and preserved for winter feeding. The grass for silage must be harvested in an optimum moment.

- Some farmers spread the grass by mower to achieve a better wilt, with the objective to remove excessive moisture for silage. This process could generate rows in the land due to accumulation of grasses. In many cases, this makes grasses undistinguishable from arable land using remote sensing techniques.

- Fertilizers are applied.

- Agricultural grassland could be reseeded.

- Usually there are farm buildings (silages; covered yards; stables, etc.) around.

- Often/mainly used for grazing.

- Improved grassland could be included in rotation. In many countries and in European regulations (as EC Regulation 796/2004 related to EU agricultural policy) an area is considered as "permanent grassland" if the land is covered by grasses during at least five years.

Per definition, there is no tree or scrub presence in improved grasslands

In between the intensively used grass farmland or in specific regions (as the *bocage* landscape in France), there can be plots of less intensive or extensive grassland, e.g. mowed only once a year. This type of grasslands (lowland and mountain hay meadows) could be considered as semi-improved grasslands (*prairie* in France; *prado* in Spain). Like in mountain alpine meadows, the percentage of wild floral species can increase. These grasslands can content trees and scrubs, especially trees walls around the parcels.

![Schematic representation of managed (semi-improved) grasslands](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image221.jpeg)

Managed grasslands are discriminated from arable land using Landsat and VHR images, specific colour and structure patterns (arable land parcels are generally more angular in shape than pastures and the texture is smooth) and the identification of cultivation tracks, but a certain grade of confusion between two classes is expected. Arable land, in Continental; Mediterranean and Nordic environments, typically appears on flat lowland soils with clay / fine sediment and few blocks. They are therefore generally more angular in shape than pastures and the texture is smooth.

- Managed grasslands with scrub and trees (basically due to processes of land abandonment in mountains but also in lowland environment) where grasses are dominant.

- Improved and semi-improved grasslands without trees.

|---------------------------|-----------------------------------|------------------------|
| **Land use**              | Managed land parcel normally used for hay production | Normally used for grazing either because it cannot be mowed or because it is located on poor soils (calcareous soils, etc.). Normally never used for hay production |
| **Environmental conditions** | Normally located in more humid environments (except semi-natural tall-herb humid meadows) and more fertile soils (as at bottoms of river valleys). | Normally located in poor soils areas (calcareous soils, sands, etc.). In many cases (Mediterranean areas) conditioned by a period of water scarcity (usually summer-time). |
| **Degree of management**  | Grassland that is more or less frequently mowed and/or managed in other ways. More homogeneous grass coverage. In specific conditions could be irrigated. In the case of grassland with trees they could be also managed (e.g. cut for forage). | The herbaceous plants are natural but are created and maintained as permanent grasslands by non-intensive activities, such as grazing. Less homogenous grass coverage. |
| **Landscape**             | Normally artificially limited by fences, tree lines, small stone walls and other type of structures in order to facilitate its management. Normally small regular parcels. | Normally larger areas, and normally with no parcel structure. In many cases presence of trees and shrubs due process on natural vegetation invasion or land abandonment |
| **Location**              | Near villages, fertile soils of valleys and accessible areas | Normally located on slopes or poor soils which limit the production. Located in less accessible areas. |

By (semi-) natural grasslands we mean areas where the herbaceous plants are natural but are created and maintained as permanent grasslands by less intensive agricultural activities[^6]. Here are also included marginal grasslands: abandoned crop invaded by grasses; areas near roads and other infrastructures; abandoned dumping sites, etc.

Semi-natural grasslands include both dry grasslands and mesic grasslands:

- [*Dry Grasslands:* The EUNIS definition of dry grassland is: "*Well drained or dry lands dominated by grass or herbs, mostly not fertilized and with low productivity. Included are \[Artemisia\] steppes. Excluded are dry Mediterranean lands with shrubs of other genera where the shrub cover exceeds 10%; these are listed as garrigue* (F6)[^7]."]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

  The Annex I of Habitat Directive considers diverse grassland types as dry grasslands, from **calcareous grasslands of central and western Europe,** to steppes in Pannonic region or pseudo-steppes in Mediterranean areas. In all cases, these are grasslands located in less fertile soils, and are extensively managed (not ploughed and rarely fertilized) and used for livestock grazing. In Annex I this type of grasslands are considered as semi-natural.
  
  In the Mediterranean Region, dry grasslands are considered by the Annex I of Habitat Directive as **pseudo-steppes**. They are characterized by their loss of greenness in summertime and are devoted to livestock grazing. In Hungary and other countries, we find steppes grasslands (known here as *puszta*), as part of the dry grasslands. **Pannonian steppes** are flat alluvial plains dominated by herbaceous plants extensively managed and strongly transformed by agriculture. Turkey is also dominated by the **Eurasian steppe** (Central Anatolia steppe; Easter Anatolia Montane Steppe and Ponto-Sarmatic steppes in the Black Sea region). Semi-natural dry grasslands are also present in **salt steppes** and in **gypsum steppes** across Europe. Mediterranean salt steppes (Limonietalia); Iberian gypsum vegetation (Gypsophiletalia) and Pannonic salt steppes and salt marshes are also considered as semi-natural grasslands. Nordic ***alvar*** grasslands are also included here. These grasslands are located in dry calcareous and limestone bedrocks, covered by snow in winter and subject to strong winds. Regularly clearing is necessary to avoid scrubs. Coastal grasslands as ***machairs*** (specific coastal old landscape present in dunes in western Ireland and Scotland) dominated by grasses are also included.
  
  In the case of steppes (Anatolian steppe) and Mediterranean pseudo-steppes (dry Mediterranean grasslands), grasses and grass-like plants are mixed with patches of rocks and/or sparsely vegetated areas. These habitats (especially Anatolian steppes) are characterized by low biomass due to dry conditions and poor soils. In many cases these steppes suffer for over-grazing and erosion[^8]. As results, especially during summer time, it is not feasibly the distinction using EO data between areas covered by grasses (classes 4 *Grassland*) and rocks and areas with sparsely vegetation (classes *6* *Open spaces with little or no vegetation*). In this case has been adopted the concept of steppes and pseudo-steppes as an edaphic climax habitat dominated by grasses and grass-like plants but with a high presence of sparsely vegetated areas. In this sense, generalization rules are applied (inclusion as grassland patches of low vegetation biomass) in order to avoid an excessive mapping fragmentation.
  
  Dry grassland in Atlantic and Continental regions are restricted to very located sites affected by poor soils conditions such as calcareous dry grasslands in Western Germany, grasslands located in chalk cliffs in Denmark, grassland located in karstic regions in the Balkans or Nordic *alvars*[^9].

- [*Mesic Grasslands:* The EUNIS definition of mesic grasslands (E2) is: "*Lowland and montane mesotrophic and eutrophic pastures and hay meadows of the boreal, nemoral, warm-temperate humid and Mediterranean zones. They are generally more fertile than dry grasslands (E1) and include sports fields and agriculturally improved and reseeded pastures*". In EUNIS habitat classification[^10], the habitats are separated according the presence of water: waterlogged (the water table at or above ground level for at least half of the year), permafrost (habitats where the soil is at a temperature of less than 0^o^C throughout the year) and other (always dry; mesic, moist or humid; only seasonally wet; regularly but infrequently flooded or occasionally flooded by extreme weather conditions but which are free-draining; wet but not waterlogged; permanent snow and ice.). Here we consider mesic grasslands as mesic and moist or humid grasslands. The separation between mesic grasslands and wetlands is that the latter are waterlogged or frequently flooded.]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

  Taken into account Annex I Habitat Directive and EUNIS classification following grasslands types are included here:
  
  - Semi-natural humid meadows: wet pastures (including riverine meadows), Mediterranean alluvial meadows and Northern boreal alluvial meadows.
  
  - Mesophile grassland not included in *4.1 Managed grassland,* including abandoned hay meadows.

**4.2.2 Alpine and sub-alpine natural grassland**

**Definition:**

According EUNIS definition "*primary and secondary grass- or sedge- dominated formations of the alpine and subalpine levels of boreal, nemoral, Mediterranean, warm-temperate humid and Anatolian mountains*"[^11].

This category includes following natural grasslands identified in Annex I Habitat Directive:

- 6140 *Siliceous Pyrenean Festuca eskia grasslands*[^12] (in the Pyrenees and Cantabrian mountains in Spain);

- 6150 *Siliceous alpine and boreal grasslands*[^13] (acidic grasslands of mountains in the Alps, Carpathians and Scandinavia together with higher mountains elsewhere in northern Europe such as in the north of the British Isles);

- 6160 *Oro-Iberian Festuca indigesta grasslands*[^14] (located in the high Mediterranean mountains of the Iberian Peninsula); and

- 6170 *Alpine and subalpine calcareous grasslands* (present in the Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathian and Scandinavian mountains, highest mountains of Corsica, Apennines, Cantabrian, Betic and Iberic mountains in Spain, Dinaric Alps, the mountains of Greece and Turkey and the Scottish Highlands[^15])

These natural grasslands are known commonly as *alpine meadows.* In all the cases, these alpine meadows involve grasses growing above the limits of the mountain hay meadows and forests (in many cases in areas with mountain scrublands and barren rocks).

The majority of these alpine grasslands are grazed traditionally in summertime under traditional transhumance regimes.

Per definition, there are no trees in alpine grasslands or their presence is rare.

Related EUNIS Habitat Classification: E4.

***This category includes***:

- Natural grasslands (occasionally grazed) above the tree line[^16] with low fraction of bare rock or gravel, shrubs and sporadic trees. Grasslands cover at least 30% of the surface in combination with alpine heathland or other forms of vegetation which sums up to at least 50% vegetation cover. Areas with less than 50% vegetation cover are considered *6.1 Sparsely vegetated areas*. Marginally managed grassland close to the tree line with high grasses density and no land plot structure present are also included here.

- In the case of Nordic countries this class includes natural grasslands and extensive/former grazed grasslands above the tree line.

***This category excludes:***

- Mountain hay meadows (managed grasslands) below tree line → *4.1* *Managed grassland*.

- Alpine heaths usually located between the tree line and the grasslands formations → *5.1 Heathland and scrub.*

- Surfaces covered by mosses and lichen → classes *6 Open spaces with little or no vegetation*.

- Grasslands with less than 50 % field cover (in climax stage), such as snow bed grassland → classes *6 Open spaces with little or no vegetation.*

# 5 Heathland and scrub{.unnumbered}

![](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/picture7.png)

Heathland and scrub is divided into three classes depending on whether the shrubby vegetation is evergreen and adapted to water loss (*Sclerophyllous scrubs*) or not. If not, it is distinguished between low growing heath vegetation (*Heathland and moorland*) and tree-like shrub vegetation (*Alpine scrub land*).

*Heathland and moorland* appear in both temperate and frigid zones. Areas with heath and dwarf scrub vegetation adheres to the *5.1* *Heathland and moorlands*. Areas dominated by brush woods and bush-like forest in sub-alpine areas close to the tree limit adheres to the *5.2* *Alpine scrub land*.

Sclerophyllous scrubs appear in Mediterranean region. As a general rule, the geographical distribution of sclerophyllous scrub is congruent with the cultivation of olive trees.

***This category includes:***

- **5.1 Heathland and moorland**

- **5.2 Alpine scrub land**

- **5.3 Sclerophyllous scrubs**  {{< pagebreak >}}

**5.1 Heathland and moorland**

**Definition:**

Areas with low and closed cover, dominated by brush, bushes and herbaceous vegetation or dwarf shrubs. They are mostly secondary ecosystems with unfavourable natural conditions. The field layer has a cover \> 50 % and tree cover \< 10 %.

***This category includes:***

- Areas where the field layer has a cover of more than 50 % at the phenological mature stage. (The date of the satellite data is crucial, especially in the northern countries where the vegetation period is short. An area may change from 0 % to 100 % green field cover within weeks).

- Heath and scrub formation in Atlantic, sub-Atlantic and sub-Continental areas with *Ulex spp*., *Calluna vulgaris*, V*accinium spp.*, *Erica spp*, *Genista spp.*, *Vaccinium myrtillus* and *Rubus spp*.

**Attributes:**

- [N/A]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

**Appearance:**

- In Scandinavia this vegetation type occurs in a mosaic with mire vegetation, alpine grasslands, alpine willow bushes and rocky ground. This requires generalization where 5.1 should cover at least 70 % of the delineated area.

- In alpine areas, the delineation between grass heath (*4.2.2*) and herbaceous heath (*5.1*) is associated with low accuracy when validated in field. A recommendation in the interpretation is to consequently also use additional supporting data.

*Matorral* in South-Western Spain. In Mediterranean areas, rain is concentrated in spring and autumn and red colours in scrubs are not rare as is the case.

**Methodological advice**:

- Sometimes is complicate to distinguish this class from the forested areas, as the colours in the SPOT image are quite similar (sometimes the only difference is density). Therefore, auxiliary information is necessary to support a correct interpretation and delineation.

- Use of CLC class 3.2.3 as information source.

- Use HRL Forests to detect the trees, which can be potentially, *5.3 Sclerophyllous scrubs*.

- Final detailed delineation and identification using computer assisted visual interpretation.   {{< pagebreak >}}

# 7 Wetland{.unnumbered}

![](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image355.png)

According to Article 1.1 of the Ramsar Convention[^28] (1971), wetlands are: "*areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters*". Wetland refers to both inland freshwater/saline wetlands and coastal salt marshes influenced by the sea.

Inland wetlands are predominantly **water-logged** specific plant and animal communities supporting **water regulation** and **peat-related processes**. This class includes natural or modified mires, bogs and fens, as well as peat extraction sites[^29]. Surfaces of temporary water are included in wetlands. According EUNIS guidelines (see table below), water-logged means the presence of the water table at or above ground level for at least half of the year.

Coastal salt marshes, according to the EUNIS habitat description, are dominated by sediments and salt-tolerant stands of vegetation, occurring on the extreme upper shore of sheltered coasts and periodically covered by high tides

These classes include according EUNIS habitat types: salt marsh drift lines, upper salt marshes, mid-upper salt marshes and saline brackish reed, rush and sedge beds and littoral sediments not included in *7.2.3 Intertidal flats*, classes *6.2.1 Beaches* or *6.2.1.2 Dunes*. Salines (active ones and in process of abandonment) will be also identified, based on CORINE land cover and computer assisted visual interpretation. Intertidal flats are un-vegetated areas covered by mud, sand and rock and not included in the classes *6.2.1 Beaches, 7.2.1 Salt marshes* or *8.3.2* *Estuaries*.

***Adaptation of water interpretation in EUNIS***[^30] ***and related LC/LU classes of the CZ nomenclature.***

![](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image3.png)

![](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image4.png)

A decision criteria tree is established to clarify guideline distinctions between Level 5 classes as follows:

![](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image356.png)

***This category includes:***

- **7.1 Inland wetlands**

  - 7.1.1 Inland marshes

  - 7.1.2 Peat bogs

    - 7.1.2.1 Exploited peat bog

    - 7.1.2.2 Unexploited peat bog

- **7.2 Coastal wetlands**

  - 7.2.1 Salt marshes

  - 7.2.2 Salines

  - 7.2.3 Intertidal flats   {{< pagebreak >}}

**7.1.1 Inland marshes**

**Definition:**

Inland wetlands without a direct connection to the open ocean with significant content of water, which is influenced by a certain seasonal fluctuation.

This category corresponds to 411 CORINE Land Cover class (Inland marshes), and includes both, inland freshwater marshes and inland salt marshes.

Inland saline marshes (also including reed coverage) are created where saline ground water rises to the surface, or in endorheic basins. This class is located predominantly in Pannonic region (*Pannonic salt steppes*), Turkey, in Mediterranean specific locations and in endorheic basins across Europe.

Inland freshwater marshes include areas covered by reeds and not covered by reeds (basically mud areas and/or waterlogged grasses and grass-like plants). Grasslands highly wet and visible in the images are included here.

***Reed*** is a common name for several tall, grass-like plants of wetlands and rivers. They are all members of the order Poales: *Poaceae*, *Cyperaceae*, *Sparganiaceae*, *Typhacea* or *Restionaceae*. Reed in marshes groups basically two types of plants:

- Sedges (*Cyperaceae* family) are monocotyledon plants with solid and triangular stems; 3-ranked leaves; with flowers, and lenticular or triangular fruits. Sedges are common in wet habitats, including marshes, and in tundra habitats.

- Rushes (*Juncaceae family*) are monocotyledon plants with solid and mostly round stems; few leaves, only basal or reduced to sheaths; with flowers and fruits in capsules. Rushes are common in wet habitats.

Lakes and ponds inside inland wetlands ≥ 0.5 ha are considered as *8.2* *Lakes and reservoirs*.

***This category includes:***

- Areas flooded at least six months a year with low or no vegetation.

- Areas where reeds are harvested.

- Reed covered wetland along river sides.

- Reed beds in saline marshes with coverage less than 30%.

- Marshes (freshwater or salt) with or without vegetation (reeds) coverage.

- Grasslands highly wet or flooded at least six months a year.

- Bare soils as results of previous presence of water will be also included within this category.

- It will be taken into account that the Baltic Sea has only brackish coastal waters, which qualify for inland freshwater marshes.

- Limestone mires.

- **In Nordic conditions:** *7.1.1 Inland marshes* include non-grazed/mowed and non-peat producing wetlands. These areas normally have a vegetation of tall grasses and sedges.

***This category excludes:***

- Floating aquatic vegetation (species such as *Nuphar* spp., *Nymphaea* spp., *Potamageton* spp. and *Lemna* spp.) is not considered as reeds and is included in classes *8 Water*.

- Grassland highly wet or flooded less than six months a year → *4.1 / 4.2.1 Managed or semi-natural grassland* located in mesic environments.

- Open water ≥ 0.5 ha in wetland areas (*8.2.1 Natural lakes).*

- Rice fields → *2.1.1 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land.*

- Mesic/moist grasslands → *4.1 / 4.2.1 Managed or semi-natural grassland* located in mesic environments

- Reeds mixed with trees (\> 5m) in rivers banks → classes *3 Woodland and forest.*

- Shrub along river sides and on river banks (may include small patches of reeds with area \< 0.5 Ha) where neither climax tree-like forest formations nor grassland is detected (mainly located in areas of Mediterranean and continental climates with a summer season with warm-temperate & low precipitation) → *3.4 Transitional woodland and shrub.*

- Marine wetlands such as salt marshes or salines → classes *7.2 Coastal wetlands*.

- Inland exploited salines and extraction of sodium minerals in salt marshes, salt lakes or other locations → *1.3.1.1* *Mineral extraction sites*.

- Mires with more than 30% of tree cover density are considered as classes *3 Woodland and forest.*

- Check GIO wetlands Layer.

- Map orange brown-green/red-blue/Blue-grey areas as classes *7 Wetland.*

- Map other neighbouring grassland areas as *4.2.1 Semi-natural grassland* (located in mesic environments).

**Methodological advice:**

- Main identification will be based on **CORINE Land Cover** class 4.1.1 and **Soils Map of Europe.**

- The existing knowledge on locations of large inland salines (Southern Europe, Pannonian Region or Turkey) will be taken into account and their surrounding ecosystems will be analysed in order to detect possible occurrences of salines in *7.1.1 Inland marshes.*

- The dividing line between the wetland and water classes is difficult to define without the contribution of images of different dates during the same year (in order to take into account the seasonality). The **GIO-Land HR Water/Wetland Layers** may help to identify the boundaries between those two classes, but it should be noted that the pixel size of GIO-Land HR Layers is 20m and the production of GIO-Land HR Layers is based on the analysis of imagery corresponding to different years (2006-2009-2012), not to different seasons.

- Other important datasets to detect these boundaries are **Natura 2000 Network** and **Wetland Ramsar Sites** databases. They are particularly relevant in the Mediterranean area and are highly recommended to use in the detection of Wetland Areas and Areas of Special Concern.

- Any available ancillary or in-situ data sources will also be used.

[Special case in Nordic conditions:]{.underline}

- In the case of Nordic countries, when typical mire/peat structures cannot be seen in the satellite image/orthographic photo, it is difficult to determine if an area is peat producing or not. Therefore, the position in the terrain is used for guidance. Areas directly adjacent to bigger rivers or lakes are included in *7.1.1 Inland marshes* when visual interpretation is insufficient. This is because of lower chances of peat production when oxygen from flowing water is supplied to the ecosystem as opposed to ecosystems adjacent to standing water.

- Non-peat producing wetlands with a low-growing vegetation of grasses and sedges are generally grazed/mowed. These areas are included in *7.1.1 Inland marshes*.

- Non-grazed/mowed and non-peat producing wetlands normally have a vegetation of tall grasses and sedges and are included in *7.1.1 Inland marshes*. Temporarily flooded areas with low grasses and sedges are included in *4.2.1 Semi-natural grassland* (located in mesic environments).   {{< pagebreak >}}

**7.1.2.1 Exploited peat bog**

**Definition:**

Open exploited peat producing wetlands that are not greatly affected by lakes, sea water or water from water courses. Exploited peat bogs are characterized by linear trench and parcel structure.

**7.1.2.2 Unexploited peat bog**

**Definition:**

Open unexploited peat-producing wetlands that are not greatly affected by lakes, sea water or water from water courses.

In Nordic conditions this class is normally a heterogeneous vegetation type where mire vegetation dominates in a mosaic of heath vegetation, alpine grassland, alpine willow bushes and a rocky ground.

Alternative names are proposed for this class as "Peat producing land" or "Peat bog and other peat producing land".

# 8 Water{.unnumbered}

![](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/Picture8.png)

This level comprises all rivers and lakes, which are the permanent freshwater inland surface waters, as well as coastal water bodies influenced by saline sea water like lagoons, marine inlets and estuaries. This includes water courses and water bodies[^33]. Open sea is also included in this parent class.

Level 2 differentiates:

Water courses, which are separated according to their morphology into the riparian systems: interconnected rivers, streams or springs and separated water bodies belonging to the river systems (oxbow lakes or dead side-arms, flood ponds, etc.).

- Inland water bodies of natural, semi-natural and artificial origin

- Transitional waters at the coastline, which extend inland

- Coastal waters and open sea

**In general, for this category, the water level visible in the EO data used for interpretation will be mapped. Where the water is missing, the current land cover seen in the image will be mapped. This general principle is valid for lakes (especially** **dams, barrages and lakes of hydropower stations), rivers, oxbows, fishponds, etc.**

***This category includes:***

**8.1.1 Natural** **& semi-natural water courses**

**Definition**

Natural stream of water that empties into another body of water or into the sea. Also, water courses that cease to flow for part of the year, leaving a partially dry bed or water pools (EUNIS definition class C2.5) are included here. Different classes of temporary rivers are considered[^34]: snowmelt and glacier meltwater; perched and semi-perched alluvial; and karstic non-permanent streams.

Permanent running water courses occur throughout Europe but are characteristic of well-watered areas as Atlantic and Continental biogeographical regions. In the Mediterranean region they are restricted to large water courses.

[Treatment of permanent/temporary separated water bodies belonging to the river system:]{.underline}

In order to prevent mapping exceptional events such as floods, non-distinction should be applied between permanent and temporary separated water bodies belonging to the river system. Temporary separated water bodies belonging to the river system mainly correspond to riverine flooding covering old oxbows and other terrain depressions. In those areas, land may be covered with shallow, slow-moving floodwater for days or even weeks as exceptional situations. In these cases of temporary flooded areas, *permanent* land cover will be mapped (e.g. grasslands, wetlands or agricultural features).

These temporary water ponds are affected by a recurrent dry phase or are located in specific geomorphological sites such as karstic formations (e.g. turloughs in Scotland and Ireland or ponds in poljes and dolines in Balkan countries and other karst sites in Europe). Here are not included temporary natural water bodies (ponds and lakes) related to wetland and coastal systems, temporal ponds within the river system, boreal snow-melt pools and ponds from abandoned or restored quarries.

These temporary ponds are characterized by their small size, inherently shallow and their variability related to the water permanency (in many Mediterranean locations these ponds contain water only during very humid years). Many of these ponds have been converted to arable land. New small ponds have been created across Europe for cattle watering using rainfall or underground water.  {{< pagebreak >}}

**8.2.2 Reservoirs**

**Definition:**

Ponds with completely man-made structure. In Mediterranean countries water reservoirs are used for irrigation and located in agricultural surroundings. This category includes ponds and water basins for industrial use/sewage not connected with buildings and other facilities and storage tanks.

The main characteristics of highly artificial water bodies are rectangular shape, concrete border, sometimes fenced.

Despite the name, this class does not include semi-natural water bodies created by the construction of a dam.

![Schematic representation of typical coastal lagoon landscape.](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image436.png)

The following types of coastal lagoons are considered according their main morphological characteristics:

  **Isolated lagoons**: These are shallow bodies of water separated from the sea by a sand barrier (dunes and beaches). These lagoons are connected to the sea at limited points. Typical of Mediterranean coastal areas. In Spain called *Albuferas*.
  
![Schematic view of La Albufera coastal lagoon (Valencia, Spain).](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image437.png)

- [In many cases, these coastal lagoons separated by sand barriers, are open to the sea due to sea erosion or other processes (**leaky, restricted or open type lagoons**). In other cases, they are surrounded completely by sand banks. Many of these lagoons are man-made transformed (especially by the construction of roads on the sand barriers).]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

[Discrimination of marshes in coastal lagoons areas:]{.underline}

Reed and vegetated areas in coastal lagoons areas are considered as *7.2.1 Salt marshes.*

![Limnes Voulkaria Kai Saltini Natura 2000 site, Greece. SPOT-5 (2.5 m) (1/2/3 band combination). Date: 2011-02-05. Source: CNES 2011©, Distribution Airbus DS/Spot Image.](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image442.png)

Marshes could be located in following situations in coastal lagoons:

A.  Reed beds and marsh plants inside coastal lagoons.

B.  Reed beds and marsh plants located in the shoreline of coastal lagoons.

C.  Reed beds and marsh plants dividing two coastal lagoons.

D.  Reed beds and marsh plants separated from coastal lagoons not related with estuaries or coastal lagoons.

In the case of complex coastal lagoons (coastal lagoons related to coastal wetlands and estuaries) vegetation (reed beds and marsh plants) will be classified as *7.2.1 Salt marshes.*

![Concept of coastal marshes: A, B, C and D situations are considered as 7.2.1 Salt marshes](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image443.png)

![Schematic concept for differentiation between 8.3.1 Lagoons / 7.2.1 Salt marshes.](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image444.png)

Special cases are coastal lagoons covered by reed bed and marsh plants and the presence of a tidal channel. In these cases, the tidal channels will be classified as *7.2.1 Salt marshes.*

![Schematic representation of typical estuary morphology](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image448.png)

In delta rivers, the area where the river meets the sea is classified as *8.3.2* *Estuaries*. The area affected by tides (presence of mud in the image) inside the deltaic system and not covered by vegetation is also classified as *8.3.2* *Estuaries.*

![Schematic representation of level 5 classification of Axios Delta (Greece)](Coastal_Zones_2012_2018_Nomenclature_Guideline-media/image4501.png)

The limits between *8.1.1 Natural & semi-natural water courses* and *8.3.2* *Estuaries* is based in the following practical visual rules:

- There is a clear narrowing of the river channel → the limits is drawn where the river begins to be wider. Usually, there are muddy areas from this point.

- The estuary is formed by a river and a major tributary and the river begins to be wider → the limit is the confluent of two rivers.

- In deltas and at big rivers where no difference in the width of the channel is apparent and salt marshes or complex coastal systems are present → the limit is the point where wet mud banks forming salt marshes or old wetlands transformed by agriculture appear.

**Methodological advice:**

- Computer assisted visual interpretation complemented by ancillary information. The delimitation *8.3.2* *Estuaries* / *8.1* *Water courses* will be determined by the photo-interpreter according to morphological characteristics as e.g. river junctions or other geographic elements as bare or sandy capes.

- CORINE Land cover class 522 Estuaries*.*

**8.3.3 Marine inlets and fjords**

**Definition:**

Marine inlets and fjords are valley-shaped openings in the coastline stretching inland. Fjords are created through glacier activity where a valley is carved out and later submerged because of rising sea level. Marine inlets, e.g. ria coast in north-western Spain, originate from rivers forming a valley which is flooded due to a rise of sea level. Both can have a complex structure of branches, which may unite to one before entering the sea. Water inside marine inlets and fjords are influenced by the sea and its tide and are therefore saline. Delineation on the water surface is a straight line between the two points of entry into the sea on each side of the inlet. In contrast to the often long and linear shaped fjords, marine inlets can have a very broad funnel shaped opening to the sea. To differentiate between a marine inlet and a bay (8.4.2 Coastal waters) a river terminating in the marine inlet or a dry valley formerly shaped by a river can be used as indicator.

**8.4.2 Coastal Waters**

**Definition:**

Water area between the coastline (or the theoretical coastline in case of estuaries, inlets, fjords, etc.) and the open sea.

The European water framework directive defines coastal waters as \"*surface water on the landward side of a line, every point of which is at a distance of **one nautical mile** on the seaward side from the nearest point of the baseline from which the breadth of territorial waters is measured, extending where appropriate up to the outer limit of transitional waters*\"[^39]. Hence the coastal waters extend from the landward extent of either the coastal or transitional waters out to one nautical mile from the baseline. According to the United Nations Convention on the on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) the baseline is measured as the low-water line except along the mouths of estuaries and heads of bays where it cuts across open water.[^40]

- The delineation between 8.4.1 Open sea and 8.4.2 Coastal waters will be made by GIS operations considering a specific buffer from the coastline.

- Use of EU DEM as indication of coastal line and the exterior border of intertidal flats.

- Use of Transitional Waters layer (European Union Framework Directive) as indication of limits between open sea and coastal wetlands/coastal lagoons/intertidal flats.

- National data (coastal line from national supporting data such as topographical maps is used as a support to define the borderline between water courses and coastal sea).

- Supporting remote sensing data and depth data to delineate from *8.2 Lakes and reservoirs*.

- Computer assisted visual interpretation of SPOT-5 data.
