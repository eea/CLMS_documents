# Mapping guide

## Product description

### Land Use / Land Cover mapping

The Urban Atlas service offers a high-resolution land use map of urban areas. Initially covering over 300 European cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants for the 2006 reference year, the Urban Atlas is available for the 2012 and 2018 reference years over nearly 800 cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants distributed among EU, EFTA and West Balkan countries plus United Kingdom and Turkey. Each Urban Atlas product is generated over the city and its surroundings, according to the Functional Urban Area (FUA) defined by the implementation of the approach developed by the DG Regional and Urban Policy (REGIO) of the European Commission.

The product described in this mapping guide is adapted to European needs (discussed and agreed with DG REGIO) and contains information that can be derived mainly from Earth Observation (EO) data backed by other reference data, such as Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Open Street Map (OSM) navigation data and topographic maps.

### Additional information layers

The Urban Atlas Mapping Guide is related to the main product and by default refers to the Land Use / Land Cover (LU/LC) database. However, two additional information layers are also available starting from the 2012 reference year. A short description including the detailed specifications is proposed in this section.

The first one is called Street Tree Layer (STL), a separate layer from the Urban Atlas LU/LC map produced within the level 1 urban mask for each FUA (partial coverage for 2012 reference year). It includes contiguous rows or patches of trees along the streets.

: Detailed specifications of Urban Atlas STL product

The second one is a Digital Height Model (DHM) providing building bloc height information. This consists of a 10 m x 10 m resolution raster layer containing height information generated for urban areas of selected cities (currently the core area of capitals of all countries covered by the Urban Atlas).

The building height information is derived from IRS-P5 stereo images of the reference year 2012. It contains only the heights of the building bloc itself (i.e. trees are masked out). As described in the terms of reference, the mean absolute error of the height must be below 3m. This is verified by comparing the measured values with reference values and described in a validation report.

: Detailed specifications of Urban Atlas DHM product

## General guidelines

### Pre-processing and geo-coding of EO data

The EO data provided to the Service Provider should already be pre-processed. In order to reach the 1/10,000 expected scale, EO data should be provided with spatial resolution less than 5Â meters. Service Provider should check the geometric quality of the delivered EO data, but no further pre-processing step is expected. The EO data for the European Urban Atlas 2012 is the optical VHR2 coverage over EU 2011-2013 (DWH_MG2b_CORE_03) available on Data Warehouse (DWH) of the European Space Agency (ESA). The EO data for the Urban Atlas 2018 is an optical VHR coverage over EU 2017-2019 also available on ESA DWH. Change detection task can be supported by Copernicus Sentinel-2 data (10 m resolution).

### Pre-processing and geometric adaptation of navigation data

The EO data are the basis for interpretation and classification. In case of geometrical differences between EO data and navigation data (COTS or OSM), the navigation data has to be corrected in line with the EO data.

The pre-processing and application of the navigation data (COTS or OSM) shall be done according to the methodology defined in Annex 5.2.

### Pre-processing of topographic maps

Topographic maps can be used for interpretation of objects. Topographic maps should be used in digital form with precise geo-coding. The usage of printed (analogue) maps is not recommended. In case of geometrical differences between EO data and topographic maps, the erroneous data (either EO-data or topo-maps) needs to be identified using reliable datasets providing spatial reference information. The geometry of the mapping product shall then be congruent with the correct dataset.

### Classification and interpretation

Application of automatic classification routines, such as segmentation and clustering, may be applied whenever appropriate:

Automated segmentation and classification to achieve an initial differentiation between basic land cover classes (urban vs. forest vs. water vs. other land cover) is possible following a decision of the service providers.

As the backbone for the object geometry, the navigation data network (COTS or OSM) is recommended but only with the method defined in the Annex.

Manual refinement and classification at the finest level of the LU/LC classification especially within urban areas by means of visual interpretation of EO data remain necessary to be compliant with the product specifications. For this purpose, the following sections provide the rules and principles to be applied.

### Use of Copernicus HRL imperviousness

Among the reference products from Copernicus Land Monitoring Services (CLMS), the pan-European High-Resolution Layer (HRL) Imperviousness (formerly named Fast Track Sealing layer, FTS) is used for the classification at level 4 of the residential or mixed use urban fabric units classified 1.1.2 from EO data

The assignment of the imperviousness/soil sealing levels or density (i.e. classes 1.1.2.1 - 1.1.2.4) shall be carried out using the HRL Imperviousness layer or similar one. The Quality Assurance (QA) process will check only if the technical approach agreed with DG REGIO is respected but will not assess the absolute accuracy of these classes.

### Data format of the final product

ESRI ArcGIS compatible or open source OGC-standard vector format with polygon topology:

- Complete coverage in a single area feature layer.

- No overlapping polygons, gaps, duplicates or missing polygon labels or node overshoots.

- Final vectors need to have a smooth appearance (no pixel-shaped polygons are allowed). The smoothing shall be done by the service provider by methods preserving the geometry of objects. It is to ensure that smoothed vectors still comply with the minimum width and minimum mapping units required for objects.

![Example provided of the number for UA class 1.1.2.1](Urban_Atlas_Mapping_Guide_V6.3-media/image1.jpg)

![](Urban_Atlas_Mapping_Guide_V6.3-media/image2.jpg)

Column data format:

CODE_yyyyy: 5 digits in Long Integer format without decimal places (values allowed: 11100 to 92000 (all class codes))

The complete description of the data format is provided in section 5.4.

### Interpretation rules

- The delineation is to be done on the EO data. EO data should be considered as the primary (guiding) data source.

- The interpretation of the object is done using:

  - The EO data, topographic maps, navigation data (COTS or OSM) and other relevant ancillary data.

  - Auxiliary information including local expertise.

- The interpreted area should be interpreted with a minimum 100 m extension (100 m buffer) to ensure accuracy and continuity of polygons. During the post-processing phase, a subset with the spatial extent of the final product will be generated. At the borders of this subset (i.e. the final product), polygons smaller than the MMU may be present. To be in line with this rule, please note that a 100m extension buffer has been applied over sea / ocean for the coastal FUAs for the 2012 & 2018 products.

- In areas where two or more scenes overlap, the most recent data must be used for delineation and interpretation.

- In case of cloud coverage over the most recent scene, the affected part (only this part!) shall be interpreted using a cloudless alternative scene.

<!-- -->

- If two or more objects are overlapping at different levels, the top level is mapped continuously, e.g. road bridge over railway is mapped as seen, the railway polygon is split in two parts and the road is mapped as a continuous feature.

- In case of two or more objects overlapping at the same height level, the visually dominant and complete object (in use and shape) is mapped continuously. For example, a road / railway crossing viewed at the same height level: the railway shall be mapped continuously to maintain the network. The road shall be split in two parts.

- Analysis scale : 1:5 000

### LU/LC change detection and layer generation

In case of the required production of an update of the Urban Atlas LU/LC database for a historic or new reference year, change detection task shall be performed and an additional layer shall be produced by the service provider, the Land Use / Land Cover (LU/LC) change layer. For the European Urban Atlas, following the LU/LC product generation for the 2006 reference year, change detection were performed successively for generating the 2012 and 2018 products.

Change detection and characterization shall be performed considering the VHR ortho-rectified optical satellite imagery as the reference. Adopting a manual methodological approach based on the visual comparison between the images from two different reference years is always required, but it can also be combined with automatic change detection approaches (image-to-image or map-to-image) which should improve the performances. Otherwise, as the change layer shall [only contain real changes]{.underline} between two reference years, any inconsistencies of LU/LC codes will not be considered as a change if due to thematic misclassification inherited from the LU/LC information related to the first reference year already available. In such a case, it is worth to correct LU/LC misclassifications related to this year and generate a revised status layer accordingly.

In the specific case of the change detection between 2012 and 2018 for the European Urban Atlas, LU/LC misclassifications from 2012 are corrected but only in the immediate surroundings of the actual LU/LC change area, which led to produce a revised LU/LC 2012 status layer. Otherwise, LU/LC changes from, to, or within urban areas are detected, extracted and characterized at the finest level of the nomenclature, in accordance with the MMUs listed below. However, LU/LC changes occurring within rural/natural areas are mapped only if the change occurs at level 1 of the nomenclature, then well characterized at the finest level (ex: change from 31000 to 23000). In other words, changes that occur within the same rural/natural areas are not mapped (for instance, changes from 21000 to 22000 are not identified and therefore not included in the change layer).

Changes are firstly reported in an intermediate layer identified as Urban Atlas 2012-2018 LU/LC which contains the LU/LC information for both reference dates, 2012 and 2018. More concretely, based on the 2012 LU/LC information, polygon features of detected changes are delineated and characterized for 2018. Then, the change layer is generated, but it is worth to highlight that it is not performed by a fully blind extraction of all area features for which LU/LC classification codes are different. Indeed, there are one exception for which the area features are not considered for generating the change layer: isolated structures logically classified as 11300 for 2012 reference year and classified as continuous or discontinuous urban fabric unit (11100 or 11200) for 2018 only because of urban expansion over the period but without any actual LU/LC change (contextual reason). This means that for getting real changes occurred between 2012 and 2018, the 2012-2018 change layer shall be used; combining both status layers and extracting the features which have different LU/LC classifications overtime will not provide this information.

A particular case : forest cuts.

As it is often quite difficult to predict the future LU/LC over an area resulting from a forest cut, the rule applied is the following:

- Forest cuts are included in Class 31000 named 'Forests' by default as it is mentioned in Section 4.6, and systematically in case such areas are fully surrounded by wooded area.

- Forest cuts are included in another class as soon as they occur at the edge of the forest and that the context given by VHR reference imagery justifies such a choice (e.g. pastures, orchards, future construction site, etc.).

### Street tree layer 

The Street Tree Layer 2012 (STL2012) and Street Tree Layer 2018 (STL2018) are separate layers from respectively the UA2012 and UA2018 LU/LC Layers, which are produced within the levelÂ 1 urban mask for each FUA. They include contiguous rows or patches of trees covering 500mÂ² or more and with a minimum width (MinMW) of 10 m over "Artificial surfaces" (nomenclature classÂ 1) inside FUA (i.e. rows of trees along the road network outside urban areas or forest adjacent to urban areas should not be included).

The following specific rules have to be applied:

- [Exception to the 10 m MinMW rule: in order to maintain continuity, units smaller than 10 m over a distance up to 10 m can still be included in STL (see figures below).]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

![](Urban_Atlas_Mapping_Guide_V6.3-media/image22.jpg)

- [Border effect correction: road network crossing wooded area and connecting cities and villages is fully classified as STL due to tree crown cover by default. Therefore, post-processing step needs to be implemented for correcting this misclassification.]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

![](Urban_Atlas_Mapping_Guide_V6.3-media/image24.png)

An urban mask analysis to exclude road and railway networks connecting cities and villages shall be applied to solve this border effect. Urban Mask analysis needs to define a tolerance fixed to 50 m that well differentiate urban and interurban networks. Large railway infrastructures may be excluded from the mask, but this is not an issue knowing that trees are very rare in such areas.

![](Urban_Atlas_Mapping_Guide_V6.3-media/image25.jpg)

STL patches do not cover roads (codes 12210 and 12220) or railways (code 12230) connecting cities, that are outside the urban mask.

- MMU rule (\>500 mÂ²) is applied to STL polygons (STL = 1)

- The STL layer contains trees (STL = 1) or No data (STL= 99).

###  Digital Height Model layer (DHM)

A 10 m raster layer containing height information is generated for core urban areas of capital cities of the EEA38 and the United Kingdom as part of the Urban Atlas project (see table 2), based on the methodology described hereafter.

1.  [Base data]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

The input data source of stereo data is the IRS-P5 Cartosat-1. In May 2005, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had launched the IRS-P5 Cartosat-1 satellite, equipped with the PAN-Aft and PAN-Fore instruments that form a dual-optics 2-line (forward and backward looking) along-track stereoscopic push broom scanner with a stereo angle of 31Â°, an original spatial resolution of 2.5 m and a swath width of 27 km. The satellite covers the entire globe in 1867 orbits on a 126-day cycle.

Because of its optimized stereo configuration (stereo acquisitions within seconds and optimized acquisition angles), IRS-P5 Cartosat-1 high-resolution stereo satellite imagery has proven to be perfectly suited for the creation of the digital surface models in the resolution and quality requested.

The very comprehensive data situation and the unique specifications guarantee a very good coverage of urban areas in Europe by one single data source.

2.  [DSM generation]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

Based on the stereo images, a digital surface model (DSM) is generated, which represents the height of all objects above the earth's surface, i.e. plant/ forest canopy or the top of artificial constructions such as buildings.

The major steps are:

- Selection of suitable stereo images

- Pixel-wise matching approach

- Bundle block adjustment and RPC improvement

- Automated outlier detection

- Void filling

- Process QA

The result of the DSM processing chain is an accurate and reliable 3 m DSM (to get the full advantages of the higher resolution, e.g. for a better delineation of buildings), which will be further regularised to the final 10 m resolution in the nDSM generation step, to fit the product requirements.

3.  [DTM generation]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

Digital terrain models (DTMs) represent the height of the bare earth's surface. In this case, the DTMs are generated from a DSM and non-ground features such as buildings, trees, bushes and vehicles have to be identified and their height measurements be removed from the data before interpolation.

In order to ensure meeting the DTM quality requirements even in complicated terrain situations and to ensure best possible accuracy of generated DTMs, it is useful to combine the extracted ground point results of different filter methods or apply regionally adjusted algorithm parameterizations.

The interpolation approach carried out in this project is ordinary Kriging. It is the most commonly used Kriging method, used in simulations for spatial data, commonly considered to best minimizes the variance of the estimation error.

4.  [nDSM generation and refinement]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

The next step towards finally retrieving building block heights is the creation of a normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM). An nDSM is the difference between a DTM and a DSM used to show height values of buildings, vegetation and other objects.

***nDSM = DSM -- DTM***

![DSM computation principle (http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/umwelt/umweltatlas/ed610_03.htm) ](Urban_Atlas_Mapping_Guide_V6.3-media/image29.png)

As there are vegetation and other untilled areas included in the raw nDSM, hence a substantial further quality refinement with different ancillary datasets is necessary to generate a sharp and error-free digital building block height model.

Ancillary datasets consist of (i) built-up area, water and street classes of Urban Atlas 2012 and (ii) NDVI map for vegetation removal, calculated from Spot 5 seamless mosaics.

The nDSM at this stage is a 3 m resolution intermediate product that is then resampled with a maximum upscaling process to the final 10 m horizontal resolution, and which is then finally sharpened by using the borders of the built-up area classes from Urban Atlas 2012. Values outside these classes are set to Zero. Each pixel represents a height value and no statistics have been calculated based on the building block heights.

In a last refinement step the accuracy specifications are checked and if necessary, heights are adapted.

5.  [Post processing and product finalization]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

In the final post-processing and product package generation step, the properly refined nDSM with building block heights, which are considered the final product (Digital Height Models -- DHM) are checked by an automated routine for adherence to the following basic technical and formal product specifications:

- 10 m spatial resolution.

- ETRS89 -- Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection.

- Consistent file format, naming and structure, class legends and color codes.

- Correct height values / background values.

Each Building Block Height model (DHM) is clipped exactly to the AOI and assigned a folder with a corresponding name. As a further automated step, an INSPIRE compliant metadata file is generated for every product and a template for the delivery report is created for each DU and stored in the respective folder.

### Minimum mapping units and exceptions

+---------------------+-------------------------------+-----------------------+-----------------+

Exception of MMU 0.25 / 1 ha: in case of a homogeneous area \> MMU but divided in 2 or more polygons by the road or railway network, each part can be smaller to preserve the land cover information. However, no polygon can be smaller than 500 mÂ² (e.g. a 1 ha forest divided in 4 polygons by the road network has to be mapped) except for polygons at the border of the FUA (\>100 mÂ²).

The minimum mapping width (MinMW) between 2 objects for distinct mapping is 10 m.

Exception of minimum width 10m of a mapping unit: class 12220 (MMW = 6m).

Exception of minimum width 10m of a mapping unit: to maintain continuity of linear structures, they can be mapped smaller than 10 m over a distance up to 50 m (see figure below).

![](Urban_Atlas_Mapping_Guide_V6.3-media/image36.png)

Priority mapping rules for areas smaller than the MMU:

1.  Smaller areas are visually added to the adjacent unit with the thematically closest class. Rule used for the artificial codes (1xxxx).

2.  Smaller areas are added to the adjacent unit with the longest common border line, except to railways or roads (exception here: if an object is below the MMU size and completely surrounded by e.g. road or railway network it shall be aggregated with that surrounding traffic line). Rule used for the natural / semi-natural codes (2xxxx, 3xxxx, 4xxxx, 5xxxx) and all the polygons \< 100mÂ².

**Specific Minimum Mapping Units for LULC CHANGE layer :**

In order to ensure that relevant LU/LC changes are appropriately extracted, the MMUs for the LU/LC change layer (e.g. 2012-2018) are defined as below:

- Urban (class 1) to urban (class 1) = 0.1 ha

- Rural/natural (classes 2-5) to urban (class 1) = 0.1 ha

- Rural/natural (classes 2-5) to rural/natural (classes 2-5) = 0.25 ha

- Urban (class 1) to rural/natural (classes 2-5) = 0.25 ha

Considering this MMUs, exceptions are made in case of areas where changes involve road and railway networks (classes 12210, 12220, 12230); polygon features classified as road or railway for one date or directly connected to such element are extracted even if area is lower than MMU in order to keep consistency of the transportation network.

### Accuracy assessment and validation

In addition to the usual QA/QC procedure implementation, which implies visual checks for ensuring thematic and geometric positional accuracies and automatic checks for ensuring completeness and logical consistency during the post-processing phase of the production, accuracy assessment and validation must be performed independently from the production for providing the evidence that the results are fully compliant with the product specifications.

Thus, accuracy assessment follows a "double-blind" approach which means that production team and reference data team work completely independently. Reference database is obtained through the interpretation of samples which are selected based on a stratified random sampling of EEA 1km grid cell. The number of samples for each FUAs varies depending on the FUA size. The results of the reference interpretation provide the material to derive confusion matrixes, which are used to assess the accuracies.

For the DHM layer, Quality controls are conducted for each stage of the production: the DSM and DTM generation, the nDSM production, the masking and the nDSM / Building Block Height refinement. Thus, the emerging dataset is quality checked several times throughout the process.

Every product is accompanied by a DHM QC Report, which shows the results of the external Quality Check and an INSPIRE compliant xml file: [Building Height 2012 --- Copernicus Land Monitoring Service](https://land.copernicus.eu/local/urban-atlas/building-height-2012?tab=download).

## LU/LC nomenclature

The Urban Atlas Land Use / Land Cover classification is derived from CORINE Land Cover and is composed of 27 classes distributing among 5 thematic groups, namely:

1.  Artificial surfaces

2.  Agricultural areas

3.  Natural and (semi-)natural areas

4.  Wetlands

5.  Water

Four hierarchical levels are defined in the nomenclature for artificial surfaces (class 1) while only two are defined for the non-artificial ones (classes 2-5). The table below shows the LU/LC nomenclature providing class codes and descriptions and any information or ancillary data source useful for the product generation in addition to EO data.

A decision matric below illustrate the rules followed to apply LULC nomenclature to each identified feature.

### 1. Artificial surfaces{.unnumbered}

Surfaces with dominant human influence and without agricultural land use.

These areas include all artificial structures and their associated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces.

Artificial structures are defined as buildings, roads, all constructions of infrastructure and other artificially sealed or paved areas.

**Associated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces** are areas functionally related to human activities, except agriculture.

Also, the areas where the natural surface is replaced by extraction and / or deposition or designed landscapes (such as urban parks or leisure parks) are mapped in this class.

The land use is dominated by permanently populated areas and / or traffic, exploration, non-agricultural production, sports, recreation and leisure.

**1.1  URBAN FABRIC**

Built-up areas and their associated land, such as gardens, parks, planted areas and non-surfaced public areas and the infrastructure, if these areas are not suitable to be mapped separately regarding the minimum mapping unit size.

Basically, the classes 1.1.1 and 1.1.2. are distinguished by their degree of soil sealing.

Residential structures and patterns are predominant, but also downtown areas and city centres, including the Central Business Districts (CBD) and areas with partial residential use, are included.

The urban fabric classes (1.1) are distinguished only by their degree of soil sealing not by their type of buildings (single family houses or apartment blocks).

The detailed descriptions of the different classes below are given to the interpreters to support the delineation of mapping objects with homogeneous sealing density (without being required to assign the exact density classes).

Using the navigation data as a skeleton for the urban area, in many cases it is necessary to subdivide the blocks formed by the navigation data due to the different sealing density of the residential areas or different functions of the buildings and their associated land.

After completion of the interpretation, the sealing level information from the IMD sealing layer is integrated into the data.

***1.1.1  CONTINUOUS URBAN FABRIC***

Special note:

Mapping the 3rd level is done only with the defined application of the IMD sealing layer.

> *MMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m*

Land Cover:

Average degree of soil sealing: \  80%

Built-up areas and their associated land, if these areas are not suitable to be mapped separately regarding the minimum mapping unit size.

Buildings, roads and sealed areas cover most of the area; non-linear areas of vegetation and bare soil are exceptional.

Land Use:

Predominant residential use: areas with a high degree of soil sealing, independent of their housing scheme (single family houses or high-rise dwellings, city centre or suburb).

Included are downtown areas and city centres, and Central Business Districts (CBD) if there is partial residential use.

***1.1.2  DISCONTINUOUS URBAN FABRIC***

Special note:

Mapping the 4th level of density classes is done only with the defined application of the imperviousness / soil sealing layer.

Land Cover:

Average degree of imperviousness / soil sealing: 0 - 80%

Built-up areas and their associated land (small roads, sealed areas including non-linear areas of vegetation and bare soil), if these areas are not suitable to be mapped separately regarding the minimum mapping unit size.

This type of land cover can be distinguished from continuous urban fabric by a larger fraction of non-sealed and / or vegetated surfaces: gardens, parks, planted areas and non-surfaced public areas.

Land Use:

Predominant residential usage. Contains more than 20% non-sealed areas, independent of their housing scheme (single family houses or high-rise dwellings, city centre or suburb).

The non-sealed areas might be private gardens or common green areas.

Not included are:

Farms with large buildings (agro-industrial production), â†’ class 1.2.1.

Nurseries with dominant areas of greenhouses (no or only small fields) â†’ class 1.2.1.

Allotment gardens â†’ class 1.4.2.

Holiday villages ("Club Med") â†’ class 1.4.2.

*1.1.2.1  DISCONTINUOUS DENSE URBAN FABRIC*

> *MMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m*

Average degree of soil sealing: \> 50 - 80%

Residential buildings, roads and other artificially surfaced areas.

*1.1.2.2  DISCONTINUOUS MEDIUM DENSITY URBAN FABRIC*

> *MMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m*

Average degree of soil sealing: \> 30 - 50%

Residential buildings, roads and other artificially surfaced areas. The vegetated areas are predominant, but the land is not dedicated to forestry or agriculture.

*1.1.2.3  DISCONTINUOUS LOW DENSITY URBAN FABRIC*

> *MMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m*

Average degree of soil sealing: 10 - 30%

Residential buildings, roads and other artificially surfaced areas. The vegetated areas are predominant, but the land is not dedicated to forestry or agriculture.

*1.1.2.4  DISCONTINUOUS VERY LOW DENSITY URBAN FABRIC*

> *MMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m*

Average degree of soil sealing: \<10 %

Residential buildings, roads and other artificially surfaced areas. The vegetated areas are predominant, but the land is not dedicated to forestry or agriculture. Example: exclusive residential areas with large gardens.

***1.1.3 ISOLATED STRUCTURES***

> *MMU 0.25 ha, Maximum Mapping Unit 2 ha, MinMW: 10 m*

Isolated artificially structures with a **residential component**, such as (small) individual farmhouses and related buildings.

It must contain only a few houses (1 to 5 houses: depending on the size of the houses and the number of associated buildings), otherwise it should be included in class 1.1.2.

**The mapping unit is no larger than 2 ha**, otherwise it should also be included in class 1.1.2.

To be in line with this eligibility rule (regarding level 1 of the nomenclature, artificialized areas), if the considered feature is neighbouring another urban class polygon(s) other than transportation network, and the total surface of the considered polygons is above 2 ha, the area should be considered as class 1.1.2 rather than 1.1.3"

Comment : In this kind of areas under development, some small areas are considered as class 1.1.2 (and not 1.1.3) because of the presence of neighbouring areas classified as 1.3.4 (artificial areas).

**1.2  INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, PUBLIC, MILITARY, PRIVATE AND TRANSPORT UNITS**

- Water courses or ponds with a strongly variable surface level.

All water bodies and water courses visible in the imagery are mapped as long as they exceed an extent of 1 ha.

Water courses are mapped continuously also when water surface is covered by vegetation. If the water is partly obscured, e.g. by vegetation, the delineation shall be oriented to other parts of the water where it is not obscured.

Included are:

- Seasonal rivers, if the water course is visible in the EO data, otherwise â†’ class 2.

- Fishponds with distance \< 10 m are mapped together.

The navigation (COTS or OSM) data water layer may be used as a reference for interpretation. However, delineation of water areas must be done using the EO data, as the geometric accuracy of a OSM data water object is too rough for mapping on the scale 1:10 000.

Not included are:

Shallow water areas covered with reed \> MMU â†’ class 2 Seasonal rivers, if the water course is not visible in the EO data â†’ class 2.

### 6. Miscellaneous {.unnumbered}

Concerning the UA2006 products, areas with EO data provision problems were classified in separate classes described below.

a)  [No data (Clouds and shadows)]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

Areas affected by clouds or shadows on the EO data have to be mapped with ancillary data if the cloud or/and shadow overlays with the "CGC_RG_LAEA" layer (priority areas corresponding to the cities and greater cities according to the EC/OECD definition of cities (2011) provided by DGÂ REGIO). An additional layer called "CGC_CLOUD_CAPI" delineating the areas classified by other data sources (Google Earth or other relevant available data sources) than the VHR2 coverage (DWH_MG2b_CORE_03) will be produced.

Outside these priority areas, class 9.1 (code 91000) will be used for areas covered by clouds and shadows over the satellite images where land use/land cover is not possible to be determined.

b)  [No data (Missing imagery)]{custom-style="NormalLine"}\

This class 9.2 (code 92000) includes areas without available satellite image or inadequate imagery (e.g. no STL data can be produced as the image acquisition is outside the vegetation period).  {{< pagebreak >}}

## Pre-processing and geometric adaptation of navigation data

The navigation datasets (COTS or OSM) by default include a specific and hierarchical classification of the road network. Two basic categories are important within the context of the Urban Atlas. The first category gives information about the Functional Road Class (FRC), i.e. the road type, the second one gives information about the importance of each road within the city traffic network (Net2Class).

The navigation data currently used shows the following categories for FRC/type and Net2Class:

+----------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **FRC (COTS)** |   **Type (OSM)**                     |   **Full name**                             |
+:==============:+:====================================:+=============================================+
| **0**          |   motorway                           |   Motorway, Freeway or another Major Road   |
+----------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **1**          |   trunk                              |   Major Road less important than a Motorway |
+----------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **2**          |   trunk_link                         |   Other Major Road                          |
+----------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **3**          |   primary                            |   Secondary Road                            |
+----------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **4**          |   secondary                          |   Local Connecting Road                     |
+----------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **5**          |   secondary_link                     |   Local Road of high importance             |
+----------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **6**          |   tertiary                           |   Local Road                                |
+----------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **7**          |   residential, service, unclassified |   Local Road of minor importance            |
+----------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+
| **8**          |   track, path, steps, cycleway       |   Other Road                                |
+----------------+--------------------------------------+---------------------------------------------+

| **Net2Class** | **Importance Level**             |
|--------------:|----------------------------------|
| **0**         | First class (Highest)            |
| **1**         | Second class                     |
| **2**         | Third class                      |
| **3**         | Fourth class                     |
| **4**         | Fifth class                      |
| **5**         | Sixth class                      |
| **6**         | Seventh class (Lowest)           |

USAGE OF NAVIGATION DATA FOR THE URBAN ATLAS

The navigation data (COTS or OSM) will be used to generate the street and railroad network of the mapping product. This network will serve as a "backbone" and is decisive for the look and feel of the final product.

The data is delivered in line vector format by the data provider. These lines need to be widened so that the traffic line network of the final product covers the transport areas in the EO data.

For that purpose, a usage and buffering strategy was developed to implement the navigation data into the product.

The integration of the traffic network shall be done in advance of all other visual or (semi) automatic delineation and labelling of objects.

The goal of the traffic line implementation process is to ingest a traffic line network into the mapping product that covers all traffic lines wider than 10 m (including their associated land -- see traffic line description: class 1.2.2) and -- on the other hand -- is COTS-efficient to integrate.

To achieve that goal the following strategy was developed:

- The railway network is delineated individually if it exceeds a minimum width of 10 m including its associated land.

- The most important roads (FRC classes 0, 1) will be delineated individually.

- Most of the roads (FRC classes 2 to 5) will be ingested by buffering the line vectors. The buffered roads will have an overall width of at least 10 m. The buffering width for each FRC class will be adapted to the local conditions of each individual city to resemble the overall characteristics of the local traffic network.

- Certain roads (FRC class 6 and above) will be mapped if available (by buffering) or left out according to the decision of the service provider. This is to preserve a common look and feel of the mapping products of different cities.

The following table gives an overview of the road network processing approach:

| **FRC**         | **Net2Class 1**        | **Net2Class 2**        | **Net2Class 3**        | **Net2Class 4**        |
|-----------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|------------------------|
| **0**           | Manual                 |                        |                        |                        |
| **1**           | Manual                 |                        |                        |                        |
| **2**           | Estimated buffer width | Estimated buffer width | Estimated buffer width | Estimated buffer width |
| **3**           | Estimated buffer width | Estimated buffer width | Estimated buffer width | Estimated buffer width |
| **4**           | Estimated buffer width | Estimated buffer width | Estimated buffer width | Estimated buffer width |
| **5**           | Estimated buffer width | Estimated buffer width | Estimated buffer width | Estimated buffer width |
| **6 and above** | Mapping decided on city by city basis                                                                             

The general procedure for the road buffering is as follows:

PRE-PROCESSING

- Identification of the different combinations for fields Net2Class and FRC.

- Decision whether to include FRC=6 or not based on visual inspection.

- Sampling of several streets (up to service provider) for each combination.

- Estimation of mean width for each combination.

- The use of VHR imagery (e.g. Google Earth) is recommended. If the city is not available in VHR, a city with similar morphology in the same country may be used along with the EO data for production.

PROCESSING

- Buffering implementation.

- Manual delineation of streets FRC=0 and 1.

POST-PROCESSING

- Manual delineation of streets wider than 10 m that have not been buffered previously (i.e. not present in the street network layer or belonging to combinations not considered for buffering).

- Correction (elimination / edition) of errors due to inaccuracies of the line street network or buffering process.

Post-processing will be implemented according to service provider's production chain.
