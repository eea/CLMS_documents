# Executive summary

Copernicus is the European Union's Earth Observation Programme. It offers information services based on satellite Earth observation and in situ (non-space) data. These information services are freely and openly accessible to its users through six thematic Copernicus services (Atmosphere Monitoring, Marine Environment Monitoring, Land Monitoring, Climate Change, Emergency Management and Security).

The **Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS)** provides geographical information on land cover and its changes, land use, vegetation state, water cycle and earth surface energy variables to a broad range of users in Europe and across the world in the field of environmental terrestrial applications.

CLMS is jointly implemented by the **European Environment Agency (EEA)** and the European Commission’s DG **Joint Research Centre (JRC)**.

The **High-Resolution Layer (HRL)** vegetated land cover characteristics are a set of harmonised yearly maps dedicated to the thematic themes **Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands** and **Croplands**. Those include a rich suite of raster products mapping the yearly status of those land cover types at a spatial resolution of 10 meters and change layers at 3-yearly interval and 20-meter resolution. HRL vegetated land cover characteristics extends the time-series of the existing HRL’s Tree Cover & Forests and Grasslands and complements the CLMS portfolio with new layer dedicated to the mapping of crop types and agricultural practices such as mowing, harvest and cover crops.

# Lineage of HRL Tree Cover and Forests, Grasslands, and Croplands

**High Resolution Layers (HRL)s** on **Tree Cover & Forests** had already been established in the **Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS)** portfolio since the reference years 2012 producing initially a **Dominant Leaf Type**, a **Tree Cover Density**, and a **Forest Type** map at a spatial resolution of 20 meters (Figure 3-1). Change layers and reference datasets were included with the reference year 2015. At the same time the accuracy targets were raised towards at least 90% user’s and producer’s accuracy. A further important step followed with the first production for the reference years 2018 (further referred to as **Historic HRL Forest 2018**) where the spatial resolution of the status layers was raised to 10 meters, the implementation of the change layers was partially reconsidered and target accuracies for the change layers were defined. In addition, new aggregated layer depicting the density of coniferous and broadleaved tree cover was introduced. With the **HRL Tree Cover & Forests** starting from the reference year 2018 the product specifications have been kept largely in line with the definitions used for the Historic HRL Forest 2018 whereas major changes concerned in particular the move to a yearly update cycle for the status layers and changes to some confidence layers (not shown in Figure 3-1). The new HRL Tree Cover & Forests therefore replace and extend the Historic HRL Forest 2018. This does not include an update of the change layer 2015 – 2018; the new status layers for 2018 are therefore not consistent with the original change layers 2015 – 2018.

HRL’s on **Grasslands** had already been established in the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (CLMS) portfolio since the reference years 2015 producing initially a status layer on the absence / presence of grassland (Figure 3-1) with a target Overall Accuracy of 85%. With the reference year 2018 the spatial resolution of the status layers was raised to 10 meters and a change layer with a target Overall Accuracy of 80% was introduced. With the **HRL Grasslands** starting from the reference year 2018 the product specifications have been kept largely in line with the definitions used for the **Historic** **HRL Grassland** **2018** whereas major changes concerned in particular the move to a yearly update cycle for the status layers, an additional yearly **Herbaceous Cover** layer (including also temporary grassland in the reference year), new layers on the count and timing of Grassland Mowing (Minimum Mapping Unit of 0.25 ha) and changes to some confidence layers (not shown in detail in Figure 3-1). The new HRL Grasslands therefore replaces and extends the Historic HRL Grassland 2018. This does not include an update of the change layer 2015 – 2018; the new status layers for 2018 are therefore not consistent with the original change layers 2015 – 2018.

The **HRL Croplands** is a new set of layers dedicated to agriculture and comprises several yearly layers mapping crop types (10-metre spatial resolution) and agricultural practices such as harvest, fallow land and secondary crops (10-metre spatial resolution, Minimum Mapping Unit of 0.25 ha).

# Review of User Requirements

In the frame of the **Horizon 2020 (H2020)** project **ECoLaSS** a survey \[5\] of key stakeholders has been performed in order to evaluate the user requirements towards the evolution of existing and future **Copernicus** products. This survey also made use of the results from the Nextspace User Study \[6\] and revealed that **HRL** users like European institutions, service industry, research and academia, national agencies, regional administrations, NGS or private users would in general appreciate:

-   High thematic quality/meaningful and application-oriented product definitions;

-   Sufficient spatial and timely resolution concerning both, status layer and change layer;

-   Short update cycles;

-   Change monitoring;

-   Free and open access;

-   High technical quality;

-   Standardized and comparable nomenclature;

-   Transparent and scientific workflows and state-of-the-art methodology;

-   Detailed documentation of these workflow and the respective methodology;

-   Consistency of the Pan-European products enabling synergistic use of all products;

-   Streamlining the pan-European product with global ones;

-   Availability of historic data and compatibility of time series;

-   Open access to the original Copernicus Sentinel data;

-   Sophisticated product presentation and visualisation possibilities in an online viewer on the Copernicus platform;

-   **IPCC** conformity.

While many of these requirements had already been satisfied with previous HRL reference years some could only be implemented within the current update:

-   A long-standing thematic gap in the European **CLMS** portfolio concerning the monitoring of agriculture has been addressed though new products on crop types and agricultural activities. This also improves the separation between grassland and cropland and the IPCC conformity;

-   Yearly update cycle for status layer;

-   Grassland use intensity (or the dynamics of intensification/ extensification) is partially addressed through a new product on Grassland mowing.

Further requirements that remain to be considered for future updates are for example:

-   More fine-grained differentiation among species-rich (extensively used) and separation from species-poor (intensively used) and managed grassland;

-   Tree-species compositions and shifts between extensive and intensive management;

-   Increased timeliness of availability of the products: The mid-term goal is a product provision at latest 12 months after the end of the reference year.

# Product structure - What are the High Resolution Layers?

The **High Resolution Layers (HRL)** vegetated land cover characteristics portfolio consists of **Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands** and **Croplands** products (Figure 5-1), which together cover most of what is defined as the Biotic component of the **EAGLE** Land Cover Components[^1]. More specifically, the mapping is focused on surfaces with a vegetation cover above 30%; an exception to this is tree cover where the objective is to map tree cover with a continuous range of 1-100% **Tree Cover Density (TCD)**, i.e. also below 30%, as far as detectable from 10-metre resolution satellite imagery. This definition is also in line with the Sparsely Vegetated class in the **CLC+ Backbone Raster**[^2] and considers that detection / classification of vegetation below this threshold is typically more error prone. The definition also aims at largely avoiding overlaps with the non-vegetated land cover characteristics such as **HRL Imperviousness**, which is focused on areas with less than 10% vegetation cover during any time of the year, for a reference period of 3 year.

[^2]: https://land.copernicus.eu/en/technical-library/product-user-manual-clc-backbone-2021

Some overlaps between the three product groups are allowed by definition, for example areas with tree crops (i.e. olive, fruit and nut trees) which are included in both the Tree Cover & Forests and the Croplands products. Furthermore, specific vegetations types are not included in the HRLVLCC portfolio; this concerns areas dominated by natural shrubs (i.e. shrubs that are not under agricultural use) and associations of lichens and mosses.

![Figure 5-1: Products within the HRL vegetated land cover characteristics.](Product_User_Manual_v1-media/img-5ffcb441cde1eb0e5c25696fe98984f1817eb864.png)

Given several interdependencies and potential overlaps among the **Grasslands, Croplands and Tree Cover & Forests** products, the overall workflow starts with the classification of **Base Vegetation Layer (BVL)**. A high-level description is provided for the overall workflow in Figure 5-2. The yearly BVL classification initially targets the separation of 5 basic land cover classes being:

1.  *herbaceous vegetation*;

2.  *cropland*;

3.  *tree cover - coniferous*

4.  *tree cover - broadleaved*;

5.  *tree crops* (i.e. nomenclature overlap between broadleaved tree cover and permanent crops in the Croplands product);

6.  *background class* (including bare and sparsely vegetated areas and non-agricultural shrubs);

In a subsequent post-processing step two further classes are derived to delineate the:

7.  potential *overlap herbaceous – cropland* (i.e. pixels which are classified as cropland and herbaceous at least once in the time-series);

8.  The second derived class is derived from the intersection of all areas classified as tree cover and a preliminary version of the Tree Cover Density to delineate areas with low Tree Cover Density and hence allowed *overlaps of herbaceous and tree cover*.

The derived yearly BVL is considered for the downstream productions of Grasslands, Croplands and Tree Cover & Forests products as follows:

-   For the production of the Grasslands layers: all areas classified as *herbaceous, overlap herbaceous – tree cover*, or *overlap herbaceous – Cropland* are considered as the potential maximum extent for the **Herbaceous Cover (HER)** layer. In addition, the BVL classification probabilities for the *herbaceous* class are used as the main input for the derivation of the **HER** layer.

-   For the **Croplands** layers: the areas delineated as *cropland, overlap herbaceous –cropland*, or Tree Crops are considered as the maximum extent for the **CTY** classification and further refinement.

-   For the **Tree Cover & Forests** layers: the areas classified as *tree cover, overlap herbaceous – tree cover, tree crops* and the respective probabilities are used directly to derive the respective change layers and yearly **DLT** and **TCD** status layers.

Within the areas identified as *overlap herbaceous – cropland*, a further harmonization step is carried out downstream. To this end the **CTY** classification initially includes a class for *fodder crops* which are transferred to the **HER** layer if occurring in the designated overlap class.

![Figure 5-2: High-level overview of the relationship between the Base Vegetation Layer and the subsequent production of Grasslands, Croplands and Tree Cover & Forests products](Product_User_Manual_v1-media/img-813e9da3364258b08029cd0fa0b27a1c92440fc4.png)

# Product application areas and examples of use cases

The **HRL Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands** and **Croplands** set of products is designed for use by a broad user community as basis for environmental and regional analysis and for supporting political decision-making, such as the **Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), LULUCF (Land Use, Land Use Change and Forestry) )** regulation, the **Nature Restoration Regulation (NRR)**, or the proposed European **Forest Monitoring Law (FML).** With the new products the **EEA** will ensure continuity and further densification of the well-established HRL Tree Cover & Forests and Grasslands product time series. Those include a rich suite of raster products at a 3-yearly interval mapping the status of those land cover types with a spatial resolution of 10-meter and change layers at 20-meter spatial resolution.

As an example, the following sections provide short information on (potential) use cases at national level, for which the **Copernicus HRL Grasslands** product represent a fundamental input.

## Use case: Using Grassland Mowing data for CAP

The **Grassland Mowing Events** are derived using a **Sentinel-2** time-series analysis by identifying vegetation disturbances in the **Herbaceous Cover (HER)** layer. Those disturbances usually show a sharp drop of biophysical signal compared to a previously defined reference. The main difficulty is to distinguish mowing events from cloud-influenced observations or to miss mowing events due to longer cloud-related data gaps.

The information on mowing events can support the correct implementation of the European **Common Agricultural Policy (CAP)**.

![Figure 6-1: Left side: First Grassland Mowing Dates (GRAMD_1) 2021 displaying the start date of a mowing event at Airport Innsbruck, Austria Right side: Grassland Mowing Events (GRAME) 2021 displaying up to 4 mowing events at Airport Innsbruck, Austria.

## Use case: Land cover specific monitoring

Detailed and dynamic information on the state of the land as provided by the **Grasslands** layers allows to analyse regional trends in the area occupied by these land covers, which could be relevant information for authorities and policy makers. Furthermore, applications which require information on the land cover status can benefit from the **Grasslands**. For example, in case of biomass mapping often land cover specific parametrization is applied. Using the **HRL Grasslands**, allows to do this in a much more detailed and dynamic way. In case of the Evoland[^3] project, it is intended to use these layers to apply specific parametrization over crop and grassland locations.

# Product description {#sec-7-Product-description}

The **HRL Grasslands** layers are generally provided in 100km LAEA tiles as shown in Figure 7-1. The five French Oversea Territories are provided in UTM with the layout of the respective territory. The layers are available as Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs (COG) per reference year and 100km LAEA tile aligned with the **EEA reference grid**. Each raster file is accompanied by a Persistent Auxiliary metadata (PAM) XML and an INSPIRE XML.

![Figure 7-1: LAEA tile layout incl. distinction between tiles to cover EU27 and EEA38.](Product_User_Manual_v1-media/img-7cbffb4e28195ea5f90ae8fdcbdb8a4a9911aed9.jpg)

The primary layers of the **HRL Grasslands** portfolio (Figure 7-4) include the produced **Grassland (GRA)** status layer and the **Herbaceous Cover (HER)** status layer at a 10-meter resolution. Within the extent of the yearly **HER** layer, **Grassland Mowing Events (GRAME)** and **Grassland Mowing Dates (GRAMD)** are provided on a yearly basis and at a 10-meter resolution. Further layers are the **Ploughing Indicator (PLOUGH)**, the **Grassland Change layer (GRAC)** as well as three accompanying confidence layers, the **Grassland Confidence Layer (GRACL)**, the **Grassland Change Confidence Layer (GRACCL)**, as well as the **Grassland Mowing Events Confidence Layer (GRAMECL)**.

The **Herbaceous Cover (HER)** is a yearly binary layer at a 10 meter spatial resolution displaying information on the presence / absence of herbaceous vegetation cover starting from the reference year 2017. It adheres to the below definition of herbaceous cover and constitutes the basis for all other HRL Grasslands layers. A high-level overview of the dependencies among the **HRL Grasslands** layers is provided in Figure 7-2. The **HER** layer contains permanent and temporary grasslands (e.g. seeded grassland and fodder crops), in case it was the dominant land cover in the respective reference year.

The **HER** layer enables advanced users to derive temporary grasslands according to the different definitions, using the **Ploughing Indicator (PLOUGH)** and **Grassland (GRA)** layers (see description below). The **HER** layer, together with the **PLOUGH** layer, serves as the basis for deriving the **GRA** status layer by excluding all areas detected as ploughed within this period. However, an area can still be mapped as herbaceous even if a ploughing event occurred within a given year.

![Figure 7-2: Worflow dependencies of HRL Grasslands layers](Product_User_Manual_v1-media/img-c5554fecfa28620f521b7ed7b9f6161ef53ff84d.jpg)

Before generating the **GRA** layer, the **Ploughing Indicator (PLOUGH)** is derived at 10 meter spatial resolution to define the permanent grassland area. For each pixel in the **HER** layer, the **PLOUGH** layer tracks the time since the most recent ploughing event or the last time it was not covered by herbaceous vegetation. It consists of codes 0 to 6, which represent the number of years that have passed since the last disruption of herbaceous cover (for reference year 2017: 1 = 2016 and 6 = 2011).

With the introduction of the **HER** layer, some changes are applied to the historical **PLOUGH** layers from the previous 2015 and 2018 productions to maintain consistency between the three layers: **PLOUGH**, **GRA** and **HER**. Class code (o) now indicates ploughing in current year, while the former class 0 (*no ploughing information*) has been reassigned to class code *253.* Class *100* has been introduced to contain all pixels that changed between two years due to variations in the **HER** layer, where no ploughing was detected.

The first reference year for **HRL Grasslands** is 2017, meaning that ploughing information dating back to 2011 would have been required for consistency. However, the data quality for 2015 and earlier is considered rather poor due to the 20 meter spatial resolution and the mix of available imagery including very few Sentinel-2 scenes, Landsat 5, Landsat 8 and the HR_IMAGE_2012 \[8\].

Clipping the 10 meter **Grassland** layer with the 20 meter historic layers would introduce 20 meter edges, significantly affecting the final **Grassland** layer’s appearance. As a result, the **PLOUGH** for the years before 2016 was not used to mask out grassland areas.

However, ploughing information for the historic years 2011 to 2015 is still available in the **PLOUGH** for reference year 2017 and can be utilized for specific applications. As more reference years are added, historic data will gradually diminish, and starting with 2023 reference year, the **PLOUGH** layer will rely solely on Sentinel-2 data.

The **Grassland (GRA)** status layer at 10 meter spatial resolution is therefore a direct derivative of the corresponding **HER** and **PLOUGH** layer. All herbaceous areas that indicate ploughing events or herbaceous disruptions in the current and previous five years are masked out, resulting in the permanent grassland areas.

The **HRL Grasslands** portfolio also includes the **Grassland Change (GRAC)** layer at 20 meter resolution, indicating *gain* and *loss* of permanent grassland vegetation between 2018 and 2021 with a Minimum Mapping Unit of 1ha.

The **Grassland Mowing (GRAM)** layers map the number (up to four) detected mowing events and their respective start dates. The **Grassland Mowing Events (GRAME)** layer provides annual pixel-based information, starting from 2017, and contains the number of mowing events (*0, 1, 2, 3, 4*) within the detected permanent and temporary grassland extent of the **Herbaceous Cover (HER)**.

The **Grassland Mowing Dates (GRAMD)** layers provides the *day-of-year (DOY)* for the start of each mowing event. Since up to four mowing events can be detected, **GRAMD** is provided in four individual raster datasets, each depicting the DOY for the first, second, third and fourth mowing event (**GRAMD_1, GRAMD_2, GRAMD_3, GRAMD_4**), respectively. This results in four **GRAMD** layers per reference year/per **GRAME** layer (Figure 7-3).

![Figure 7-3: Grouping of GRAME and GRAMD for one reference year.](Product_User_Manual_v1-media/img-3f8e349450591978a7802510775bea060e0bdae6.png)

To reduce noise in the **GRAMD** layer, a GDAL sieve[^4] filter is applied independently to each of the four **GRAMD** layers. This filter ensures that patches of DOY-values smaller than the threshold of 0.25 ha (25 pixels) is replaced by the value of the largest neighbouring patch, but only if the size of the neighbouring patch is larger than the threshold. Since this filtering is applied individually to each **GRAMD** layer (GRAMD_1, GRAMD_2, …), in some cases, the newly assigned value is already present in one of the other mowing event date layers at the same location (i.e. the same pixels). In such cases, it results in date duplication, where timing of the first mowing event (GRAMD_1) and the second mowing event (GRAMD_2) share the same DOY. This occurs in approximately 0.4 % of the herbaceous pixels. For further information, please refer to the ATBD\[7\].

Additional layers complementing the **HRL Grasslands** portfolio are the **Confidence Layers (CL)** for which there are three: **Grassland Confidence Layer (GRACL), Grassland Mowing Events Confidence Layer (GRAMECL)** and **Grassland Change Confidence Layer (GRACCL)**. These indicate on the reliability of the classifications by providing additional information on the degree of separability of each grassland/change/mowing pixel from other land cover types. They show the confidence of the classifier for each pixel in the grassland/change/mowing classification with values ranging from *0-100% confidence*. This layer may be of interest e.g. for scientific valueadded applications, where the a-priori confidence of all input data is needed for overall error margin calculation.

## Thematic characteristics of the HRL Grasslands Product

In terms of thematic definition of the annual **Grassland (GRA)** status layer has been aligned with the **HRL Grassland 2015** and the ***Historic HRL Grassland 2018*** definition, ensuring consistency and comparability across the time series. Table 7-1 provides an overview of the **Land Cover (LC)** and **Land Use (LU)** features that shall be included or excluded in the **HRL Grasslands**. The definition encompasses natural, semi-natural and managed or cultivated grasslands (according to their origin and utilization) as well as all types of grassland (permanent or seasonal) under highly heterogeneous biogeographic conditions (wet or dry climate, fertile or poor soil). Herbaceous cover within the context of the product is understood as herbaceous vegetation with at least 30% ground cover and with at least 30% graminoid species such as Poaceae, Cyperaceae and Juncaceae. The rate of 30% ground cover density shall be understood as a benchmark implicating that grasslands with ≥30% ground cover can usually be distinguished clearly from bare ground on earth observation data with the resolution of 10 meters.

Coastal grasslands, such as grey dunes and salt meadows with at least 30 % cover of graminoids cover, are included. The definition also tolerates non-woody plants such as lichens, mosses, sedges and herbs but excludes wetlands and other peat-forming ecosystems dominated by sedges, reed beds and helophytes dominated systems, tall forbs, fern, and shrub dominated vegetation. The definition includes extensive areas of agricultural grasslands (pastures and meadows) or herbaceous fodder crops and managed recreational grasslands (e.g. lawns). Arable fields with graminoids like winter wheat, barley and rye are explicitly excluded.

The two main yearly status layers are the **Herbaceous Cover (HER)** layer and the **Grassland (GRA)** layer that reflect the important distinction between permanent and temporary grassland.

While the criteria for the distinction of permanent and temporary grasslands vary across Europe, several countries use a persistence threshold of at least 6 years. The specification of the **GRA** layer follows this convention and defines permanent grassland as stable, continuously herbaceous vegetation for at least six years, with no ploughing events occurring during that period.

The newly introduced annual **HER** layer, on the other hand, still includes both permanent and temporary grasslands (e.g. seeded grassland and fodder crops that might have been tilled within the reference year) if it was the dominant land cover in the respective reference year.

The **PLOUGH** layer records detect tilling events annually for the respective reference year and the previous six years, serving as the primary input for distinguishing between temporary herbaceous cover and permanent grassland and thus allows the derivation of the **GRA** from the **HER** layer.

The **Grassland Mowing (GRAM)** layers provide information on timing and number of mowing events where mowing is defined as the mechanical cutting of the herbaceous cover with mowing machines or scythes. Such interventions leave typical drops in the time-series of the **Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)** which can be detected automatically (Figure 7-5). The **Grassland Mowing Dates (GRAMD)** layers records the **Day of Year (DOY)** of up to four mowing events for all pixels marked as permanent and temporary grassland in reference year in the HER layer of the respective year. The Minimum Mapping Unit for the **GRAMD** is set to 0.25ha (see @sec-7-Product-description for further details on the implementation of the sieving mechanism). The **GRAME** layer is providing the total count of mowing events recorded per year.

# Production quality assessment

The aim of this chapter is to inform about the procedures for internal validation and accuracy assessment for the status and change layer with full **EEA38** coverage. While the different layers have their own quality requirements, all have in common an assessment of the thematic quality which relies on comparing mapped information within the layers with reference data at selected locations.

This procedure contains 3 steps that will be described in the following sections:

-   Sampling design

-   Response design

-   Statistical Analysis

The internal validation of the different **HRL Grasslands** layers follows scientifically accepted and operationally proven validation design, applied in previous productions of various HRL’s of reference years 2012, 2015 and 2018. According to the product specifications, results will be presented in the form of **Overall Accuracies (OA), Producer’s** and **User’s Accuracies**.

## Layers to be verified

While the full portfolio on **HRL Grasslands** includes numerous layers and reference years, only a subset of them is concerned by the internal verification exercise. The focus of the assessment has been set on the primary layer being the **Grassland (GRA)** status layer and the **Grassland Change (GRAC)** layer. Furthermore, to keep the effort for the verification manageable the reference years 2018 and 2021 have been selected to align with the availability of important reference datasets such as **LUCAS** 2018 \[2\] the VHR IMAGE coverages of 2018 and 2021 imagery and readily harmonised GSAA datasets. An overview of the verified layers and their target accuracies is given in Table 8-1.

Table 8-1: Layers to be verified and target accuracies

| Layer         | Target accuracy      |
|---------------|----------------------|
| GRA 10m 2018  | 85% overall accuracy |
| GRA 10m 2021  | 85% overall accuracy |
| GRAC 20m 1821 | 80% overall accuracy |

## Sampling Design {#sec-8-2-Sampling-Design}

The sampling approach is dedicated to assessing the accuracies of the **HRL Grasslands** layers at pan-European level and corresponds to a non-stratified, systematic and random sampling approach based on the 2 km by 2 km LUCAS grid. For the assessment of status products, 10 000 samples are randomly selected over the extended LUCAS grid (Figure 8-1). It is likely that this initial drawing will not overlap many Grassland changes between 2018 and 2021 due to the “rarity” of changes. The same is true for the HRL Tree Cover & Forest changes which have been validated with the same point set. Therefore, 4 000 additional samples are randomly drawn specifically in the changes’ strata of **Tree Cover & Forests** and **Grasslands** products (2 000 in the tree cover change strata, 2 000 in the grasslands change strata), for a total of 14 000 points samples (Primary Sampling Units) across **EEA38**.

The response design is the protocol used for retrieval of the validation/reference information for all sample units. Two types of datasets are used to perform the interpretation of samples units: guiding data and reference data.

Guiding data are those used for production of **HRL Grasslands** layers and consist mainly of timeseries of **Sentinel-2** data.

Reference data are complementary and independent data that can provide more spatial details and landscape context:

-   **VHR_IMAGE_2018**[^5] and **VHR_IMAGE_2021**[^6]: very high resolution optical earth observation imagery, covering **EEA38** for the reference years 2018 and 2021 (+-1 year). Note that at time of this exercise, the VHR_IMAGE_2021 coverage is not 100% complete. These datasets comprise earth observation imagery between 2 and 4m spatial resolution.

-   Other external datasets:

    -   **Bing maps image**/ cartography layer

    -   **Open Street Map** data

    -   **Google Earth Image** / cartography data

    -   **LUCAS** data for the year 2018 (where available)

    -   **GSAA** data for the year 2018 and 2021 (where available)

The interpretation workflow consists of thematic plausibility analysis of a sample units. This means that the class assigned by the layer is known by the interpreter during the interpretation. Depending on the layer, the interpretation workflow can differ in ways described below.

Each point sample (Primary Sampling Unit) is interpreted for each layer using the reference and guiding data. The use of **Sentinel-2** time series allows to assess the “permanent” characteristic of the herbaceous coverage over the previous years. For the **Grassland (GRA)** status layer, the interpretation is focused on the reference pixel in which the point sample is allocated considering also the direct neighbourhood to account for the **MMU** of 0.03 ha. Similarly, the interpretation of a grassland change considers the wider spatial context (typically parcel level) to consider the MMU of 1 ha when evaluating the **Grassland Change (GRAC)** layer. No SSU is used for the interpretation of the samples with respect to grasslands.

## Statistical Analysis

For the **HRL Grasslands** product the thematic accuracy levels are defined in terms of **Overall Accuracy, Producer’s Accuracy** and **User’s Accuracy** are computed as well and provided for information.

-   The **Overall Accuracy (OA)** or **Recognition Rate (Rr)** is measured by the sum of the diagonal of the Confusion Matrix divided by the total number of controlled points: $OA \; \text{or} \; R_r = \frac{\sum_{\alpha=i}^{m} (\alpha \alpha)}{T}$. The Overall Accuracy assesses the overall agreement between classified and reference data sets. However, for single class themes, it does not necessarily provide a realistic assessment of the quality of the map produced because there can be substantial unbalance between omission and commission errors.

-   The row and column totals and the diagonal of the Matrix are used to assess two further types of accuracy, the User’s and Producer’s Accuracy:

    -   **Producer’s Accuracy (PA)** for a given class = αα/Cα, representing an (inversely proportional) measure of Omission Error. For instance, an observation has been identified as tree-covered in the validation dataset but was actually classified as another class: it has been omitted from the target class.

    -   **User’s Accuracy (UA)** for a given class 𝛼𝛼/𝑅𝛼, representing an (inversely proportional) measure of the Commission Error (or contamination risk), i.e. errors due to the wrong allocation of an observation (i.e. mapped landcover) to a landcover class. For instance, an observation is classified as broadleaved tree cover but identified as belonging to another class during the validation process: this observation has contaminated another class.

As mentioned in @sec-8-2-Sampling-Design, unequal sampling intensity resulting from the stratified systematic sampling approach for change layers will be accounted for by applying a weight factor ((p)) to each Sample Unit, based on the ratio between the number of samples and the size of the stratum considered:

$$
\hat{p}_{ij} = \left(\frac{1}{N}\right) \sum_{x \in (i,j)} \frac{1}{\pi^{*}_{uh}}
$$

Where $i$ and $j$ are the columns and rows in the matrix, $N$ is the total number of possible units (population) and $\pi$ is the sampling intensity for a given stratum.

This is because the samples from the smaller strata (i.e. change layers) show a higher sampling intensity than those from the larger strata (i.e. status layers). Therefore, a correction for the sampling intensity will be applied to the error matrices produced following the procedure described by \[3\] and applied by \[4\], leading to a weighting factor inversely proportional to the inclusion probability of samples from a given stratum. Not applying this correction could result in underestimating or overestimating map accuracies. On the following sections, **confusion matrices will be presented in both weighted and unweighted version.** While the weighted versions provide statistically corrected results for accuracy figures, the application of weights make the matrix cells number difficult to read: the cells contain the number of validation samples for each category with their respective weights applied. The unweighted matrices, on the other hand, present accuracy figures that are less accurate (as the over-representation of change samples is not corrected), but the matrix cells contain number of samples for each category without their weights applied, making it far easier to understand how many validation samples falls into each category.

## Verification Results

The **HRL Grasslands** status layers for the reference years 2018 and 2021 should reach an overall accuracy of 85%. Figures derived from this verification exercise show that this target is largely exceeded, where overall accuracies are always above 95%, reflecting the high level of quality of the **Grassland (GRA)** status layer, both at **EU27** (Table 8-2) and **EEA38** (Table 8-3) level. The same applies for the **Grassland Change (GRAC)** layer which exceed the **Overall Accuracy** of 80% for both the EU27 and the EEA38 (Table 8-4).
