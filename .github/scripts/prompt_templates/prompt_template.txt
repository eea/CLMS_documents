You are analyzing git diffs of technical documentation files.

**TASK: Process exactly {{NUM_FILES}} file(s) - ALL files must be included in your response.**

Files to analyze:
{{FILE_LIST}}

**For EACH file, provide:**
1. Semantic version bump decision (MINOR or PATCH)
2. Changelog summary of changes

PART 1: VERSION BUMP ANALYSIS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Understanding Git Diffs:**
- Lines with `+` = additions
- Lines with `-` = deletions  
- Lines with `-` then `+` = modifications
- `@@` lines = line numbers (ignore)
- Context lines (no prefix) = unchanged content
- Focus on content changes, not diff syntax

**Version Bump Rules:**

**MINOR (Y++) when:**
- New chapters/sections/subsections (## or ### headers)
- New features, APIs, or functionality documented
- Significant content additions (>20% new content or >50 lines)
- Major restructuring or reorganization
- New diagrams, tables, or substantial examples
- Breaking changes in documented procedures
- New requirements or specifications
- Substantial updates to existing sections

**PATCH (Z++) when:**
- Typo/grammar fixes
- Formatting improvements (spacing, styling, markdown)
- Clarifications without new information
- Minor wording improvements
- Link updates or corrections
- Small additions (<20 lines, <5 sentences)
- Metadata-only updates (YAML frontmatter)
- Fixing broken references or cross-links
- Minor corrections to existing content

**Decision Guidelines:**
- Mixed changes: MINOR if ANY significant change
- Only YAML/metadata: PATCH
- Only formatting/whitespace: PATCH  
- If uncertain: lean towards MINOR
- Empty/no changes: PATCH

PART 2: CHANGELOG SUMMARY GENERATION
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**Format Selection Rules:**

Use **PARAGRAPH format** when:
- 1-3 related changes that flow naturally together
- Changes are to a single section or closely related topics
- Simple modifications or updates
- Format: Write 1-3 clear sentences in prose

Use **BULLET POINT format** when:
- 4 or more distinct changes
- Changes span multiple unrelated sections or topics
- Mix of additions, modifications, and removals
- Each change is independent and actionable
- Format: Use HTML unordered list format: `<ul><li>Change 1</li><li>Change 2</li></ul>`, maximum 10 items

**Changelog Writing Guidelines:**
- **Be concise but informative**: Changelogs appear in document version tables - balance brevity with clarity
- **Length limits**: 
  - Paragraph format: Maximum 3-4 sentences (60-100 words)
  - Bullet format: Maximum 8-10 items, each item 8-20 words
- **Be specific**: Instead of "updated information", write "updated processing algorithm from version 2.1 to 2.3"
- **Use concrete details**: Include version numbers, dates, parameter names, section titles, dataset names
- **Quantify when relevant**: "added 5 new validation metrics" not "added validation information"
- **Prioritize**: Lead with the most significant changes (new features > modifications > removals)
- **User-focused**: Explain the practical impact, not just the technical change
- **Active voice**: "Added new quality flags" not "New quality flags were added"
- **British English** spelling and terminology

**Changelog Examples:**

*Paragraph format (1-3 related changes) - CONCISE:*
"Updated processing algorithm from version 2.1 to 2.3, improving cloud detection accuracy by 15%. Added validation metrics (accuracy, precision, recall) and updated recommended threshold to 0.8."

*Bullet format (4+ distinct changes) - use HTML, keep items SHORT:*
"<ul><li>Updated processing algorithm to version 2.3</li><li>Added quality flag interpretation section</li><li>Added three validation metrics</li><li>Updated threshold from 0.7 to 0.8</li><li>Replaced deprecated v1 endpoints with v2</li></ul>"

*BAD - Too verbose:*
"<ul><li>Updated processing algorithm from version 2.1 to 2.3 which resulted in a 15% improvement in cloud detection accuracy according to validation tests</li><li>Added a completely new section on quality flag interpretation that includes detailed examples and explanations for each flag type</li></ul>"

*Good specificity examples (but keep BRIEF):*
✓ "Corrected Sentinel-2 spatial resolution from 20m to 10m for visible bands"
✗ "Fixed technical details about resolution"

✓ "Added troubleshooting section covering authentication, timeout, and format errors"
✗ "Added troubleshooting information"

*Remember: BREVITY is critical - these appear in version history tables*

**For minor changes only:**
- Use "Minor formatting and metadata updates" if ONLY markdown formatting, spacing, or metadata changed
- Use "Document maintenance updates" if changes are purely technical (fixing typos, broken links, formatting consistency) with no content impact

**SECURITY: HTML restrictions (CRITICAL):**
- ONLY use `<ul>`, `<li>`, and `</ul>`, `</li>` tags - NO other HTML tags allowed
- NO JavaScript, CSS, style attributes, or event handlers
- NO external links, images, or embedded content
- NO script tags, iframe, object, embed, or similar elements
- NO HTML attributes except standard list structure
- Keep content as plain text within `<li>` tags

OUTPUT FORMAT REQUIREMENTS
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT:**
You MUST return a result for EVERY file in the batch, even if you cannot analyze it.
If a file's diff is unreadable, empty, or causes analysis issues, use:
```json
{
  "version": {
    "bump": "error",
    "reason": "Cannot analyze: [specific reason]",
    "confidence": "none"
  },
  "changelog": {
    "format": "error",
    "summary": "Unable to generate changelog due to analysis error"
  }
}
```

**Required JSON Structure:**
Return a JSON object with ALL file paths as keys (one entry per file in the batch):

```json
{
  "DOCS/path/to/file1_v1.qmd": {
    "version": {
      "bump": "minor",
      "reason": "Added new section on API authentication with 3 subsections and code examples",
      "confidence": "high"
    },
    "changelog": {
      "format": "paragraph",
      "summary": "Added comprehensive API authentication section covering OAuth 2.0, JWT tokens, and API key management with practical code examples and security best practices."
    }
  },
  "DOCS/path/to/file2_v2.qmd": {
    "version": {
      "bump": "patch",
      "reason": "Fixed typos in introduction and updated formatting throughout",
      "confidence": "high"
    },
    "changelog": {
      "format": "bullet",
      "summary": "<ul><li>Fixed 8 typos in introduction and methodology sections</li><li>Standardised code block formatting for consistency</li><li>Updated broken cross-references to sections 4.2 and 5.1</li><li>Corrected unit notation from 'meters' to 'm' throughout document</li></ul>"
    }
  }
}
```

**Field Definitions:**
- `version.bump`: "minor", "patch", or "error"
- `version.reason`: Clear explanation referencing specific changes (1-2 sentences)
- `version.confidence`: "high", "medium", "low", or "none"
- `changelog.format`: "paragraph", "bullet", or "error"
- `changelog.summary`: The actual changelog text (plain text for paragraph, HTML list for bullet)

**CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS:**
✓ Include ALL {{NUM_FILES}} files in response
✓ Each file needs both version AND changelog
✓ Version bumps must match changelog significance
✓ HTML only: `<ul>`, `<li>` tags (properly closed)
✓ Changelogs: specific and concise
✓ Use British English
✓ Return ONLY valid JSON (no markdown, no explanations)

**VERIFICATION CHECKLIST BEFORE RESPONDING:**
□ Did I process file #1 in the list?
□ Did I process file #{{NUM_FILES}} in the list?
□ Do ALL files have version.bump, version.reason, version.confidence?
□ Do ALL files have changelog.format and changelog.summary?
□ Are MINOR bumps justified by significant changes in changelog?
□ Are PATCH bumps justified by minor changes in changelog?
□ Is my JSON valid (no trailing commas, all braces closed)?
□ Did I count: do I have exactly {{NUM_FILES}} keys?

**Files to include in response (verify each one):**
{{FILE_LIST}}

Begin your response with { and end with }
