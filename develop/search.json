    "text": "4.1 Product description\n\n4.1.1 Land Use / Land Cover mapping\nThe Urban Atlas service offers a high-resolution land use map of urban areas. Initially covering over 300 European cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants for the 2006 reference year, the Urban Atlas is available for the 2012 and 2018 reference years over nearly 800 cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants distributed among EU, EFTA and West Balkan countries plus United Kingdom and Turkey. Each Urban Atlas product is generated over the city and its surroundings, according to the Functional Urban Area (FUA) defined by the implementation of the approach developed by the DG Regional and Urban Policy (REGIO) of the European Commission.\nThe product described in this mapping guide is adapted to European needs (discussed and agreed with DG REGIO) and contains information that can be derived mainly from Earth Observation (EO) data backed by other reference data, such as Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Open Street Map (OSM) navigation data and topographic maps.\nDetailed specifications of Urban Atlas LU/LC product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nUrban Atlas LU/LC\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nVery high-resolution land use and land cover dataset of Functional Urban Areas\n\n\nINSPIRE themes\nLand cover\nLand use\n\n\nGeographic description\nEU, EFTA and West Balkan countries plus United Kingdom and Turkey\n\n\nTemporal description\n2006 / 2012 / 2018\n\n\nPurpose\nProvide the baseline of land use/land cover data on Functional Urban Areas extracted from VHR and other available imagery (and combined with in-situ data) to allow the study of the characteristics of these areas in comparison with major urban areas in the EU and EFTA countries.\n\n\nMinimum Mapping Unit\n0.25 ha in urban areas (level 1)\n1 ha in rural areas (level 2-5)\n\n\nMinimum mapping width\n10 m between two objects for distinct mapping\n\n\nNomenclature\nAs provided in the Chapter 4.4. table 3 (containing 27 classes)\n\n\nProjection\nETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) (EPSG 3035)\n\n\nDelivery formats\nShapefile (2006), EsriFileGDB (2012), GeoPackage (2018)\n\n\nMetadata\nINSPIRE Metadata Implementing Rules: Technical Guidelines based on EN ISO 19115 and EN ISO 19119\n\n\nPositional accuracy\nAccording to geo-location accuracy of satellite imagery delivered by ESA\n\n\nOverall classification accuracy\n≥ 85 % in urban classes (class 1)\n≥ 80 % in rural classes (classes 2 to 5)\n≥ 80 % overall accuracy\n\n\n\nThe table provided in Annex 5.3 gives a more detailed description of the product specifications.\n\n\n\nExample of the “look & feel“ of the final Urban Atlas 2012 product for Brussels\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Additional information layers\nThe Urban Atlas Mapping Guide is related to the main product and by default refers to the Land Use / Land Cover (LU/LC) database. However, two additional information layers are also available starting from the 2012 reference year. A short description including the detailed specifications is proposed in this section.\nThe first one is called Street Tree Layer (STL), a separate layer from the Urban Atlas LU/LC map produced within the level 1 urban mask for each FUA (partial coverage for 2012 reference year). It includes contiguous rows or patches of trees along the streets.\n\nDetailed specifications of Urban Atlas STL product\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nStreet Tree Layer\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nVery high-resolution tree cover dataset of inside nomenclature level 1 areas.\n\n\nINSPIRE themes\nLand cover\n\n\nGeographic description\nEU, EFTA and West Balkan countries plus United Kingdom and Turkey\n\n\nTemporal description\n2012 (partial coverage) / 2018\n\n\nPurpose\nMapping of contiguous rows or patches of trees covering inside the nomenclature level 1 areas.\n\n\nMinimum Mapping Unit\n500 m²\n\n\nMinimum mapping width\n10 m\n\n\nNomenclature\nTree (STL=1) or Nodata (99)\n\n\nProjection\nETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) (EPSG 3035)\n\n\nDelivery formats\nShapefile (2012), GeoPackage (2018)\n\n\nMetadata\nINSPIRE Metadata Implementing Rules: Technical Guidelines based on EN ISO 19115 and EN ISO 19119\n\n\nPositional accuracy\nAccording to geo-location accuracy of satellite imagery delivered by ESA\n\n\nOverall classification accuracy\n≥ 80 % in urban classes\n\n\n\nThe second one is a Digital Height Model (DHM) providing building bloc height information. This consists of a 10 m x 10 m resolution raster layer containing height information generated for urban areas of selected cities (currently the core area of capitals of all countries covered by the Urban Atlas).\nThe building height information is derived from IRS-P5 stereo images of the reference year 2012. It contains only the heights of the building bloc itself (i.e. trees are masked out). As described in the terms of reference, the mean absolute error of the height must be below 3m.

    "section": "4.2 General guidelines",
    "text": "4.2 General guidelines\n\n4.2.1 Pre-processing and geo-coding of EO data\nThe EO data provided to the Service Provider should already be pre-processed. In order to reach the 1/10,000 expected scale, EO data should be provided with spatial resolution less than 5 meters. Service Provider should check the geometric quality of the delivered EO data, but no further pre-processing step is expected. The EO data for the European Urban Atlas 2012 is the optical VHR2 coverage over EU 2011-2013 (DWH_MG2b_CORE_03) available on Data Warehouse (DWH) of the European Space Agency (ESA). The EO data for the Urban Atlas 2018 is an optical VHR coverage over EU 2017-2019 also available on ESA DWH. Change detection task can be supported by Copernicus Sentinel-2 data (10 m resolution).\n\n\n4.2.2 Pre-processing and geometric adaptation of navigation data\nThe EO data are the basis for interpretation and classification. In case of geometrical differences between EO data and navigation data (COTS or OSM), the navigation data has to be corrected in line with the EO data.\nThe pre-processing and application of the navigation data (COTS or OSM) shall be done according to the methodology defined in Annex 5.2.\n\n\n4.2.3 Pre-processing of topographic maps\nTopographic maps can be used for interpretation of objects. Topographic maps should be used in digital form with precise geo-coding. The usage of printed (analogue) maps is not recommended. In case of geometrical differences between EO data and topographic maps, the erroneous data (either EO-data or topo-maps) needs to be identified using reliable datasets providing spatial reference information. The geometry of the mapping product shall then be congruent with the correct dataset.\n\n\n4.2.4 Classification and interpretation\nApplication of automatic classification routines, such as segmentation and clustering, may be applied whenever appropriate:\nAutomated segmentation and classification to achieve an initial differentiation between basic land cover classes (urban vs. forest vs. water vs. other land cover) is possible following a decision of the service providers.\nAs the backbone for the object geometry, the navigation data network (COTS or OSM) is recommended but only with the method defined in the Annex.\nManual refinement and classification at the finest level of the LU/LC classification especially within urban areas by means of visual interpretation of EO data remain necessary to be compliant with the product specifications. For this purpose, the following sections provide the rules and principles to be applied.\n\n\n4.2.5 Use of Copernicus HRL imperviousness\nAmong the reference products from Copernicus Land Monitoring Services (CLMS), the pan-European High-Resolution Layer (HRL) Imperviousness (formerly named Fast Track Sealing layer, FTS) is used for the classification at level 4 of the residential or mixed use urban fabric units classified 1.1.2 from EO data\nThe assignment of the imperviousness/soil sealing levels or density (i.e. classes 1.1.2.1 - 1.1.2.4) shall be carried out using the HRL Imperviousness layer or similar one. The Quality Assurance (QA) process will check only if the technical approach agreed with DG REGIO is respected but will not assess the absolute accuracy of these classes.\n\n\n4.2.6 Data format of the final product\nESRI ArcGIS compatible or open source OGC-standard vector format with polygon topology:\n\nComplete coverage in a single area feature layer.\nNo overlapping polygons, gaps, duplicates or missing polygon labels or node overshoots.\nFinal vectors need to have a smooth appearance (no pixel-shaped polygons are allowed). The smoothing shall be done by the service provider by methods preserving the geometry of objects. It is to ensure that smoothed vectors still comply with the minimum width and minimum mapping units required for objects.\n\n\n\n\nExample provided of the number for UA class 1.1.2.1\n\n\n\nColumn data format:\nCODE_yyyyy: 5 digits in Long Integer format without decimal places (values allowed: 11100 to 92000 (all class codes))\nThe complete description of the data format is provided in section 5.4.\n\n\n4.2.7 Interpretation rules\n\nThe delineation is to be done on the EO data. EO data should be considered as the primary (guiding) data source.\nThe interpretation of the object is done using:\n\nThe EO data, topographic maps, navigation data (COTS or OSM) and other relevant ancillary data.\nAuxiliary information including local expertise.\n\nThe interpreted area should be interpreted with a minimum 100 m extension (100 m buffer) to ensure accuracy and continuity of polygons. During the post-processing phase, a subset with the spatial extent of the final product will be generated. At the borders of this subset (i.e. the final product), polygons smaller than the MMU may be present. To be in line with this rule, please note that a 100m extension buffer has been applied over sea / ocean for the coastal FUAs for the 2012 & 2018 products.\nIn areas where two or more scenes overlap, the most recent data must be used for delineation and interpretation.\nIn case of cloud coverage over the most recent scene, the affected part (only this part!) shall be interpreted using a cloudless alternative scene.\n\n\n\nIf two or more objects are overlapping at different levels, the top level is mapped continuously, e.g. road bridge over railway is mapped as seen, the railway polygon is split in two parts and the road is mapped as a continuous feature.\nIn case of two or more objects overlapping at the same height level, the visually dominant and complete object (in use and shape) is mapped continuously. For example, a road / railway crossing viewed at the same height level: the railway shall be mapped continuously to maintain the network. The road shall be split in two parts.\nAnalysis scale : 1:5 000\n\n\n\n4.2.8 LU/LC change detection and layer generation\nIn case of the required production of an update of the Urban Atlas LU/LC database for a historic or new reference year, change detection task shall be performed and an additional layer shall be produced by the service provider, the Land Use / Land Cover (LU/LC) change layer. For the European Urban Atlas, following the LU/LC product generation for the 2006 reference year, change detection were performed successively for generating the 2012 and 2018 products.\nChange detection and characterization shall be performed considering the VHR ortho-rectified optical satellite imagery as the reference. Adopting a manual methodological approach based on the visual comparison between the images from two different reference years is always required, but it can also be combined with automatic change detection approaches (image-to-image or map-to-image) which should improve the performances. Otherwise, as the change layer shall only contain real changes between two reference years, any inconsistencies of LU/LC codes will not be considered as a change if due to thematic misclassification inherited from the LU/LC information related to the first reference year already available. In such a case, it is worth to correct LU/LC misclassifications related to this year and generate a revised status layer accordingly.\nIn the specific case of the change detection between 2012 and 2018 for the European Urban Atlas, LU/LC misclassifications from 2012 are corrected but only in the immediate surroundings of the actual LU/LC change area, which led to produce a revised LU/LC 2012 status layer. Otherwise, LU/LC changes from, to, or within urban areas are detected, extracted and characterized at the finest level of the nomenclature, in accordance with the MMUs listed below. However, LU/LC changes occurring within rural/natural areas are mapped only if the change occurs at level 1 of the nomenclature, then well characterized at the finest level (ex: change from 31000 to 23000). In other words, changes that occur within the same rural/natural areas are not mapped (for instance, changes from 21000 to 22000 are not identified and therefore not included in the change layer).\nChanges are firstly reported in an intermediate layer identified as Urban Atlas 2012-2018 LU/LC which contains the LU/LC information for both reference dates, 2012 and 2018. More concretely, based on the 2012 LU/LC information, polygon features of detected changes are delineated and characterized for 2018. Then, the change layer is generated, but it is worth to highlight that it is not performed by a fully blind extraction of all area features for which LU/LC classification codes are different. Indeed, there are one exception for which the area features are not considered for generating the change layer: isolated structures logically classified as 11300 for 2012 reference year and classified as continuous or discontinuous urban fabric unit (11100 or 11200) for 2018 only because of urban expansion over the period but without any actual LU/LC change (contextual reason). This means that for getting real changes occurred between 2012 and 2018, the 2012-2018 change layer shall be used; combining both status layers and extracting the features which have different LU/LC classifications overtime will not provide this information.\nA particular case : forest cuts.\nAs it is often quite difficult to predict the future LU/LC over an area resulting from a forest cut, the rule applied is the following:\n\nForest cuts are included in Class 31000 named ‘Forests’ by default as it is mentioned in Section 4.6, and systematically in case such areas are fully surrounded by wooded area.\nForest cuts are included in another class as soon as they occur at the edge of the forest and that the context given by VHR reference imagery justifies such a choice (e.g. pastures, orchards, future construction site, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nChange Dynamics over FR010L2 Montpellier (2012-2018)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.9 Street tree layer\nThe Street Tree Layer 2012 (STL2012) and Street Tree Layer 2018 (STL2018) are separate layers from respectively the UA2012 and UA2018 LU/LC Layers, which are produced within the level 1 urban mask for each FUA. They include contiguous rows or patches of trees covering 500m² or more and with a minimum width (MinMW) of 10 m over “Artificial surfaces” (nomenclature class 1) inside FUA (i.e. rows of trees along the road network outside urban areas or forest adjacent to urban areas should not be included).\nThe following specific rules have to be applied:\n\nException to the 10 m MinMW rule: in order to maintain continuity, units smaller than 10 m over a distance up to 10 m can still be included in STL (see figures below).\n\n\n\n\nBorder effect correction: road network crossing wooded area and connecting cities and villages is fully classified as STL due to tree crown cover by default. Therefore, post-processing step needs to be implemented for correcting this misclassification.\n\n\n\nAn urban mask analysis to exclude road and railway networks connecting cities and villages shall be applied to solve this border effect. Urban Mask analysis needs to define a tolerance fixed to 50 m that well differentiate urban and interurban networks. Large railway infrastructures may be excluded from the mask, but this is not an issue knowing that trees are very rare in such areas.\n\nSTL patches do not cover roads (codes 12210 and 12220) or railways (code 12230) connecting cities, that are outside the urban mask.\n\nMMU rule (&gt;500 m²) is applied to STL polygons (STL = 1)\nThe STL layer contains trees (STL = 1) or No data (STL= 99).\n\n\n\n\nComparison between VHR2018 scene (left) and STL2018 product (right)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.10 Digital Height Model layer (DHM)\nA 10 m raster layer containing height information is generated for core urban areas of capital cities of the EEA38 and the United Kingdom as part of the Urban Atlas project (see table 2), based on the methodology described hereafter.\n\nBase data\n\n\nThe input data source of stereo data is the IRS-P5 Cartosat-1. In May 2005, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had launched the IRS-P5 Cartosat-1 satellite, equipped with the PAN-Aft and PAN-Fore instruments that form a dual-optics 2-line (forward and backward looking) along-track stereoscopic push broom scanner with a stereo angle of 31°, an original spatial resolution of 2.5 m and a swath width of 27 km. The satellite covers the entire globe in 1867 orbits on a 126-day cycle.\nBecause of its optimized stereo configuration (stereo acquisitions within seconds and optimized acquisition angles), IRS-P5 Cartosat-1 high-resolution stereo satellite imagery has proven to be perfectly suited for the creation of the digital surface models in the resolution and quality requested.\nThe very comprehensive data situation and the unique specifications guarantee a very good coverage of urban areas in Europe by one single data source.\n\nDSM generation\n\n\nBased on the stereo images, a digital surface model (DSM) is generated, which represents the height of all objects above the earth’s surface, i.e. plant/ forest canopy or the top of artificial constructions such as buildings.\nThe major steps are:\n\nSelection of suitable stereo images\nPixel-wise matching approach\nBundle block adjustment and RPC improvement\nAutomated outlier detection\nVoid filling\nProcess QA\n\nThe result of the DSM processing chain is an accurate and reliable 3 m DSM (to get the full advantages of the higher resolution, e.g. for a better delineation of buildings), which will be further regularised to the final 10 m resolution in the nDSM generation step, to fit the product requirements.\n\nDTM generation\n\n\nDigital terrain models (DTMs) represent the height of the bare earth’s surface. In this case, the DTMs are generated from a DSM and non-ground features such as buildings, trees, bushes and vehicles have to be identified and their height measurements be removed from the data before interpolation.\nIn order to ensure meeting the DTM quality requirements even in complicated terrain situations and to ensure best possible accuracy of generated DTMs, it is useful to combine the extracted ground point results of different filter methods or apply regionally adjusted algorithm parameterizations.\nThe interpolation approach carried out in this project is ordinary Kriging. It is the most commonly used Kriging method, used in simulations for spatial data, commonly considered to best minimizes the variance of the estimation error.\n\nnDSM generation and refinement\n\n\nThe next step towards finally retrieving building block heights is the creation of a normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM). An nDSM is the difference between a DTM and a DSM used to show height values of buildings, vegetation and other objects.\nnDSM = DSM – DTM\n\n\n\nDSM computation principle (http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/umwelt/umweltatlas/ed610_03.htm)\n\n\nAs there are vegetation and other untilled areas included in the raw nDSM, hence a substantial further quality refinement with different ancillary datasets is necessary to generate a sharp and error-free digital building block height model.\nAncillary datasets consist of (i) built-up area, water and street classes of Urban Atlas 2012 and (ii) NDVI map for vegetation removal, calculated from Spot 5 seamless mosaics.\nThe nDSM at this stage is a 3 m resolution intermediate product that is then resampled with a maximum upscaling process to the final 10 m horizontal resolution, and which is then finally sharpened by using the borders of the built-up area classes from Urban Atlas 2012. Values outside these classes are set to Zero. Each pixel represents a height value and no statistics have been calculated based on the building block heights.\nIn a last refinement step the accuracy specifications are checked and if necessary, heights are adapted.\n\n\n\nCoverage of Vienna core area with relevant UA 2012 built-up classes\n\n\n\nPost processing and product finalization\n\n\nIn the final post-processing and product package generation step, the properly refined nDSM with building block heights, which are considered the final product (Digital Height Models – DHM) are checked by an automated routine for adherence to the following basic technical and formal product specifications:\n\n10 m spatial resolution.\nETRS89 – Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection.\nConsistent file format, naming and structure, class legends and color codes.\nCorrect height values / background values.\n\nEach Building Block Height model (DHM) is clipped exactly to the AOI and assigned a folder with a corresponding name. As a further automated step, an INSPIRE compliant metadata file is generated for every product and a template for the delivery report is created for each DU and stored in the respective folder.\n\n\n\nFinal Digital Height Model (height values in m)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.11 Minimum mapping units and exceptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCORINE\nClasses [Lev.

However, no polygon can be smaller than 500 m² (e.g. a 1 ha forest divided in 4 polygons by the road network has to be mapped) except for polygons at the border of the FUA (&gt;100 m²).\nThe minimum mapping width (MinMW) between 2 objects for distinct mapping is 10 m.\nException of minimum width 10m of a mapping unit: class 12220 (MMW = 6m).\nException of minimum width 10m of a mapping unit: to maintain continuity of linear structures, they can be mapped smaller than 10 m over a distance up to 50 m (see figure below).\n\nPriority mapping rules for areas smaller than the MMU:\n\nSmaller areas are visually added to the adjacent unit with the thematically closest class. Rule used for the artificial codes (1xxxx).\nSmaller areas are added to the adjacent unit with the longest common border line, except to railways or roads (exception here: if an object is below the MMU size and completely surrounded by e.g. road or railway network it shall be aggregated with that surrounding traffic line). Rule used for the natural / semi-natural codes (2xxxx, 3xxxx, 4xxxx, 5xxxx) and all the polygons &lt; 100m².\n\nSpecific Minimum Mapping Units for LULC CHANGE layer :\nIn order to ensure that relevant LU/LC changes are appropriately extracted, the MMUs for the LU/LC change layer (e.g. 2012-2018) are defined as below:\n\nUrban (class 1) to urban (class 1) = 0.1 ha\nRural/natural (classes 2-5) to urban (class 1) = 0.1 ha\nRural/natural (classes 2-5) to rural/natural (classes 2-5) = 0.25 ha\nUrban (class 1) to rural/natural (classes 2-5) = 0.25 ha\n\nConsidering this MMUs, exceptions are made in case of areas where changes involve road and railway networks (classes 12210, 12220, 12230); polygon features classified as road or railway for one date or directly connected to such element are extracted even if area is lower than MMU in order to keep consistency of the transportation network.\n\n\n4.2.12 Accuracy assessment and validation\nIn addition to the usual QA/QC procedure implementation, which implies visual checks for ensuring thematic and geometric positional accuracies and automatic checks for ensuring completeness and logical consistency during the post-processing phase of the production, accuracy assessment and validation must be performed independently from the production for providing the evidence that the results are fully compliant with the product specifications.\nThus, accuracy assessment follows a “double-blind” approach which means that production team and reference data team work completely independently. Reference database is obtained through the interpretation of samples which are selected based on a stratified random sampling of EEA 1km grid cell. The number of samples for each FUAs varies depending on the FUA size. The results of the reference interpretation provide the material to derive confusion matrixes, which are used to assess the accuracies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCORINE\nClasses [Lev.

Thus, the emerging dataset is quality checked several times throughout the process.\nEvery product is accompanied by a DHM QC Report, which shows the results of the external Quality Check and an INSPIRE compliant xml file: Building Height 2012 — Copernicus Land Monitoring Service."

    "text": "4.5 Description of LU/LC thematic classes\n\n1. Artificial surfaces\nSurfaces with dominant human influence and without agricultural land use.\nThese areas include all artificial structures and their associated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces.\nArtificial structures are defined as buildings, roads, all constructions of infrastructure and other artificially sealed or paved areas.\nAssociated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces are areas functionally related to human activities, except agriculture.\nAlso, the areas where the natural surface is replaced by extraction and / or deposition or designed landscapes (such as urban parks or leisure parks) are mapped in this class.\nThe land use is dominated by permanently populated areas and / or traffic, exploration, non-agricultural production, sports, recreation and leisure.\n1.1 URBAN FABRIC\nBuilt-up areas and their associated land, such as gardens, parks, planted areas and non-surfaced public areas and the infrastructure, if these areas are not suitable to be mapped separately regarding the minimum mapping unit size.\nBasically, the classes 1.1.1 and 1.1.2. are distinguished by their degree of soil sealing.\nResidential structures and patterns are predominant, but also downtown areas and city centres, including the Central Business Districts (CBD) and areas with partial residential use, are included.\nThe urban fabric classes (1.1) are distinguished only by their degree of soil sealing not by their type of buildings (single family houses or apartment blocks).\nThe detailed descriptions of the different classes below are given to the interpreters to support the delineation of mapping objects with homogeneous sealing density (without being required to assign the exact density classes).\nUsing the navigation data as a skeleton for the urban area, in many cases it is necessary to subdivide the blocks formed by the navigation data due to the different sealing density of the residential areas or different functions of the buildings and their associated land.\nAfter completion of the interpretation, the sealing level information from the IMD sealing layer is integrated into the data.\n1.1.1 CONTINUOUS URBAN FABRIC\nSpecial note:\nMapping the 3rd level is done only with the defined application of the IMD sealing layer.\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nLand Cover:\nAverage degree of soil sealing:   80%\nBuilt-up areas and their associated land, if these areas are not suitable to be mapped separately regarding the minimum mapping unit size.\nBuildings, roads and sealed areas cover most of the area; non-linear areas of vegetation and bare soil are exceptional.\nLand Use:\nPredominant residential use: areas with a high degree of soil sealing, independent of their housing scheme (single family houses or high-rise dwellings, city centre or suburb).\nIncluded are downtown areas and city centres, and Central Business Districts (CBD) if there is partial residential use.\n1.1.2 DISCONTINUOUS URBAN FABRIC\nSpecial note:\nMapping the 4th level of density classes is done only with the defined application of the imperviousness / soil sealing layer.\nLand Cover:\nAverage degree of imperviousness / soil sealing: 0 - 80%\nBuilt-up areas and their associated land (small roads, sealed areas including non-linear areas of vegetation and bare soil), if these areas are not suitable to be mapped separately regarding the minimum mapping unit size.\nThis type of land cover can be distinguished from continuous urban fabric by a larger fraction of non-sealed and / or vegetated surfaces: gardens, parks, planted areas and non-surfaced public areas.\nLand Use:\nPredominant residential usage. Contains more than 20% non-sealed areas, independent of their housing scheme (single family houses or high-rise dwellings, city centre or suburb).\nThe non-sealed areas might be private gardens or common green areas.\nNot included are:\nFarms with large buildings (agro-industrial production), → class 1.2.1.\nNurseries with dominant areas of greenhouses (no or only small fields) → class 1.2.1.\nAllotment gardens → class 1.4.2.\nHoliday villages (“Club Med”) → class 1.4.2.\n1.1.2.1 DISCONTINUOUS DENSE URBAN FABRIC\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nAverage degree of soil sealing: &gt; 50 - 80%\nResidential buildings, roads and other artificially surfaced areas.\n1.1.2.2 DISCONTINUOUS MEDIUM DENSITY URBAN FABRIC\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nAverage degree of soil sealing: &gt; 30 - 50%\nResidential buildings, roads and other artificially surfaced areas. The vegetated areas are predominant, but the land is not dedicated to forestry or agriculture.\n1.1.2.3 DISCONTINUOUS LOW DENSITY URBAN FABRIC\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nAverage degree of soil sealing: 10 - 30%\nResidential buildings, roads and other artificially surfaced areas. The vegetated areas are predominant, but the land is not dedicated to forestry or agriculture.\n1.1.2.4 DISCONTINUOUS VERY LOW DENSITY URBAN FABRIC\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nAverage degree of soil sealing: &lt;10 %\nResidential buildings, roads and other artificially surfaced areas. The vegetated areas are predominant, but the land is not dedicated to forestry or agriculture. Example: exclusive residential areas with large gardens.\n1.1.3 ISOLATED STRUCTURES\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, Maximum Mapping Unit 2 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nIsolated artificially structures with a residential component, such as (small) individual farmhouses and related buildings.\nIt must contain only a few houses (1 to 5 houses: depending on the size of the houses and the number of associated buildings), otherwise it should be included in class 1.1.2.\nThe mapping unit is no larger than 2 ha, otherwise it should also be included in class 1.1.2.\nTo be in line with this eligibility rule (regarding level 1 of the nomenclature, artificialized areas), if the considered feature is neighbouring another urban class polygon(s) other than transportation network, and the total surface of the considered polygons is above 2 ha, the area should be considered as class 1.1.2 rather than 1.1.3”\nComment : In this kind of areas under development, some small areas are considered as class 1.1.2 (and not 1.1.3) because of the presence of neighbouring areas classified as 1.3.4 (artificial areas).\n1.2 INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, PUBLIC, MILITARY, PRIVATE AND TRANSPORT UNITS\nAt least 30% of the ground is covered by artificial surfaces. More than 50% of those artificial surfaces are occupied by buildings and / or artificial structures with non-residential use, i.e. industrial, commercial or transport related uses are dominant.\n1.2.1 INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, PUBLIC, MILITARY AND PRIVATE UNITS\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nLand cover:\nArtificial structures (e.g. buildings) or artificial surfaces (e.g. concrete, asphalt, tar, macadam, tarmac or otherwise stabilized surface, e.g. compacted soil, devoid of vegetation), occupy most of the surface. Included are associated areas, such as roads, sealed areas and vegetated areas, if these areas are not suitable to be mapped separately regarding the MMU size.\nLand use:\nIndustrial, commercial, public, military or private units. The administrative boundaries of the production or service unit are mapped, including associated features larger than the MMU (e.g. sports areas or transport structures).\nAlso included are:\n&gt; Bare soil and/or grassland potentially used for storage of material or as enclosures for livestock.\n&gt; Compounds with significant amounts of green or natural areas but with industrial, commercial, military or public use. Example: communication tower, antennas or wind motors and their associated land.\nThis class contains:\n\nIndustrial uses and related areas\n\n&gt; Sites of industrial activities, including their related areas such as storage areas.\n&gt; Production sites.\n&gt; Energy plants: nuclear, solar, hydroelectric, thermal, electric and wind farms.\n&gt; Sewage treatment plants.\n&gt; Farming industries (farms with large buildings and / or greenhouses).\n&gt; Antennas, even with predominant vegetated areas. The vegetated areas may be predominant, but the land is not dedicated to forestry or agriculture.\n&gt; Water treatment plants.\n&gt; Sewage plants.\n&gt; Seawater desalination plants.\nThe industrial units can be distinguished from residential built-up areas by the type of buildings, their access to transport features and the surroundings:\n&gt; Buildings with large surface areas (inside, not all rooms need daylight, as in dwelling houses).\n&gt; Good access to roads and parking for customers.\n&gt; Industrial areas are often outside the historical city centre.\n\nCommercial uses, retail parks and related areas\n\n&gt; Surfaces purely occupied by commercial activities, including their related areas (e.g. parking areas even larger than the MMU).\n&gt; High-rise office buildings.\n&gt; Petrol and service stations within built-up areas.\nThe commercial units can be distinguished from residential built-up areas by the type of large buildings, their access to transport features and the surroundings:\n&gt; Buildings with large surface areas (inside, not all rooms need daylight, as in dwelling houses).\n&gt; Good access to roads and parking for customers.\n&gt; Pure commercial areas are often outside the historical city centre.\nNot included are:\nPetrol stations along fast transit and main roads with access only from these roads. They are mapped together with the road transport system → class 1.2.2.1 or 1.2.2.2.\n\nPublic, military and private services not related to the transport system\n\nSurfaces purely occupied by general government, public or private administrations including their related areas (access ways, lawns, military training areas, parking areas).\nIncluded are:\n&gt; Schools and universities.\n&gt; Hospitals and other health services or buildings.\n&gt; Places of worship (churches / cathedrals / religious buildings).\n&gt; Archaeological sites and museums.\n&gt; Administration buildings, ministries.\n&gt; Penitentiaries.\n&gt; Military areas including bases and ports.\n&gt; Military exercise areas fenced and under current use.\n&gt; Castles, etc. not primarily used for residential purposes (building management, gardeners, etc…. living there is not residential use in this sense).\n&gt; Private storage areas without a residential component, such as compounds of garages.\nNot included are:\n&gt; Public parks → class 1.4.1.\n&gt; Holiday resorts including their hotels → class 1.4.2.\n&gt; Sport centres or bathing centres → class 1.4.2.\n&gt; Cemeteries → class 1.4.1 (note: for the “UA 2006” LULC production, the cemeteries were classified in class 1.2.1, they are now included in class 1.4.1 in “UA 2006 Revised” and “UA 2012” LCLU).\n&gt; Military airports → class 1.2.4.\n\nCivil protection and supply infrastructure\n\n&gt; Dams, dikes, irrigation and drainage canals and ponds and other technical public infrastructure, to be mapped with the roads, embankments and associated land included.\n&gt; Includes also breakwaters, piers and jetties, sea walls and flood defenses.\n&gt; (Ancient) city walls, other protecting walls, bunkers.\n&gt; Avalanche barriers.\nNot included are:\nNoise barriers → class 1.2.2.\nWater courses (within e.g. diked canals) if the water area is wider than 10 m → class 5; Reservoirs along natural water courses → class 5.\n1.2.2 ROAD AND RAIL NETWORK AND ASSOCIATED LAND\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 6 m (Road) - 10 m (Rail)\n\nSpecial Note:\nThe road and railway network (COTS or OSM data) is ingested into the classification database according to the method given in the Annex.\nParts of the navigation data that are obviously not congruent with the corresponding traffic line in the EO data and ancillary map need to be corrected.\nRoads which are not contained in the navigation data are mapped by the service provider according to the mapping criteria defined in this mapping guide.\nRoads or railways do not necessarily have to form a closed network. Isolated traffic lines are possible, but they are to be mapped regarding the MMU criterion.\nAssociated land is mapped with the roads / railways as it is visible in the EO data and topographic maps.\nAssociated lands are:\n&gt; Slopes of embankments or cut sections.\n&gt; Areas enclosed by roads or railways, without direct access and without agricultural land use.\n&gt; Fenced areas along roads (e.g. as for protection against wild animals).\n&gt; Areas enclosed by motorways, exits or service roads with no detectable access.\n&gt; Noise barriers (fences, walls, earth walls).\n&gt; Rest areas, service stations and parking areas only accessible from the fast transit roads.\n&gt; Railway facilities including stations, cargo stations and service areas.\n&gt; Foot- or bicycle paths parallel to the traffic line.\n&gt; Green strips, alleys (with trees or bushes).\n1.2.2.1 FAST TRANSIT ROADS AND ASSOCIATED LAND\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 6 m\n\nRoads defined as “motorways” in the navigation data, including motorway rest, service areas, tolls, parking areas, only accessible from the motorways.\nAreas surrounded by highway or railway junctions have to be included in the corresponding network.\nMotorways that are not included in the navigation data are to be mapped by the service provider.\n1.2.2.2 OTHER ROADS AND ASSOCIATED LAND\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 6 m\n\nRoads, crossings, intersections and parking areas, including roundabouts and sealed areas with “road surface”.\n1.2.2.3 RAILWAYS AND ASSOCIATED LAND\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nRailway facilities including stations, cargo stations and service areas.\n1.2.3 PORT AREAS\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nSpecial Note:\nAncillary data is recommended for identifying the administrative boundary of the port area.

However, delineation of water areas must be done using the EO data, as the geometric accuracy of a OSM data water object is too rough for mapping on the scale 1:10 000.\nNot included are:\nShallow water areas covered with reed &gt; MMU → class 2 Seasonal rivers, if the water course is not visible in the EO data → class 2.\n\n\n6. Miscellaneous\nConcerning the UA2006 products, areas with EO data provision problems were classified in separate classes described below.\n\nNo data (Clouds and shadows)\n\n\nAreas affected by clouds or shadows on the EO data have to be mapped with ancillary data if the cloud or/and shadow overlays with the “CGC_RG_LAEA” layer (priority areas corresponding to the cities and greater cities according to the EC/OECD definition of cities (2011) provided by DG REGIO). An additional layer called “CGC_CLOUD_CAPI” delineating the areas classified by other data sources (Google Earth or other relevant available data sources) than the VHR2 coverage (DWH_MG2b_CORE_03) will be produced.\nOutside these priority areas, class 9.1 (code 91000) will be used for areas covered by clouds and shadows over the satellite images where land use/land cover is not possible to be determined.\n\nNo data (Missing imagery)\n\n\nThis class 9.2 (code 92000) includes areas without available satellite image or inadequate imagery (e.g. no STL data can be produced as the image acquisition is outside the vegetation period)."

    "text": "6.1 Pre-processing and geometric adaptation of navigation data\nThe navigation datasets (COTS or OSM) by default include a specific and hierarchical classification of the road network. Two basic categories are important within the context of the Urban Atlas. The first category gives information about the Functional Road Class (FRC), i.e. the road type, the second one gives information about the importance of each road within the city traffic network (Net2Class).\nThe navigation data currently used shows the following categories for FRC/type and Net2Class:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFRC (COTS)\nType (OSM)\nFull name\n\n\n\n\n0\nmotorway\nMotorway, Freeway or another Major Road\n\n\n1\ntrunk\nMajor Road less important than a Motorway\n\n\n2\ntrunk_link\nOther Major Road\n\n\n3\nprimary\nSecondary Road\n\n\n4\nsecondary\nLocal Connecting Road\n\n\n5\nsecondary_link\nLocal Road of high importance\n\n\n6\ntertiary\nLocal Road\n\n\n7\nresidential, service, unclassified\nLocal Road of minor importance\n\n\n8\ntrack, path, steps, cycleway\nOther Road\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet2Class\nImportance Level\n\n\n\n\n0\nFirst class (Highest)\n\n\n1\nSecond class\n\n\n2\nThird class\n\n\n3\nFourth class\n\n\n4\nFifth class\n\n\n5\nSixth class\n\n\n6\nSeventh class (Lowest)\n\n\n\nUSAGE OF NAVIGATION DATA FOR THE URBAN ATLAS\nThe navigation data (COTS or OSM) will be used to generate the street and railroad network of the mapping product. This network will serve as a “backbone” and is decisive for the look and feel of the final product.\nThe data is delivered in line vector format by the data provider. These lines need to be widened so that the traffic line network of the final product covers the transport areas in the EO data.\nFor that purpose, a usage and buffering strategy was developed to implement the navigation data into the product.\nThe integration of the traffic network shall be done in advance of all other visual or (semi) automatic delineation and labelling of objects.\nThe goal of the traffic line implementation process is to ingest a traffic line network into the mapping product that covers all traffic lines wider than 10 m (including their associated land – see traffic line description: class 1.2.2) and – on the other hand – is COTS-efficient to integrate.\nTo achieve that goal the following strategy was developed:\n\nThe railway network is delineated individually if it exceeds a minimum width of 10 m including its associated land.\nThe most important roads (FRC classes 0, 1) will be delineated individually.\nMost of the roads (FRC classes 2 to 5) will be ingested by buffering the line vectors. The buffered roads will have an overall width of at least 10 m. The buffering width for each FRC class will be adapted to the local conditions of each individual city to resemble the overall characteristics of the local traffic network.\nCertain roads (FRC class 6 and above) will be mapped if available (by buffering) or left out according to the decision of the service provider. This is to preserve a common look and feel of the mapping products of different cities.\n\nThe following table gives an overview of the road network processing approach:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFRC\nNet2Class 1\nNet2Class 2\nNet2Class 3\nNet2Class 4\n\n\n\n\n0\nManual\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nManual\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\n\n\n3\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\n\n\n4\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\n\n\n5\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\n\n\n6 and above\nMapping decided on city by city basis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general procedure for the road buffering is as follows:\nPRE-PROCESSING\n\nIdentification of the different combinations for fields Net2Class and FRC.\nDecision whether to include FRC=6 or not based on visual inspection.\nSampling of several streets (up to service provider) for each combination.\nEstimation of mean width for each combination.\nThe use of VHR imagery (e.g. Google Earth) is recommended. If the city is not available in VHR, a city with similar morphology in the same country may be used along with the EO data for production.\n\nPROCESSING\n\nBuffering implementation.\nManual delineation of streets FRC=0 and 1.\n\nPOST-PROCESSING\n\nManual delineation of streets wider than 10 m that have not been buffered previously (i.e. not present in the street network layer or belonging to combinations not considered for buffering).\nCorrection (elimination / edition) of errors due to inaccuracies of the line street network or buffering process.\n\nPost-processing will be implemented according to service provider’s production chain."

Urban fabrics appear in blue and darkish blue-grey on satellite images.\nThe establishment of the boundary between continuous, dense and low density urban fabric can be difficult to delimit. The main aspects to determine these classes are either by the presence and quantity of vegetation, or by the use of the IM.D HRL.\nFrom the UA Mapping Guide:\n\nSurfaces with dominant human influence but without agricultural land use. These areas include all artificial structures and their associated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces.\nArtificial structures are defined as buildings, roads, all constructions of infrastructure and other artificially sealed or paved areas.\nAssociated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces are areas functionally related to human activities, except agriculture.\nAlso, the areas where the natural surface is replaced by extraction and/or deposition or designed landscapes (such as urban parks or leisure parks) are mapped in this class.\nThe land use is dominated by permanent population.\n\nSpecific generalization/delineation rules are applied for urban classes:\n\nSegments of roads, rivers and railways &lt; 0.5 ha, that are necessary to represent the “network” of each feature will be mapped. Features &lt; 0.1 ha will be generalized.\nUrban objects confined by roads or railways ≥ 0.25 up to &lt; 0.5ha. Smaller urban objects will be generalized.\nIf an infrastructure line is crossing a river, the bridge has to be mapped if the bridge is wider than 10 meters.\nSpecific generalization rules are applied to 1.1.1.3 Low density fabric (IM.D &lt;30%) class (see description of the specific class).\n\nThis category includes:\n\n1.1 Urban fabric, industrial, commercial, public, military and private units\nUrban fabric contains land covered by artificial structures and transport networks.

    "text": "2 Cropland\n\nCropland is the main food production area. It includes both, intensively managed ecosystems and multifunctional areas supporting many semi-natural and natural species along with food production (lower intensity management). It comprises regularly or recently cultivated agricultural, horticultural and domestic habitats and agro-ecosystems with significant coverage of natural vegetation (agricultural mosaics) (Maes et. al., 2013).\nMAES categorizes croplands in three main groups:\n\nArable Land\nPermanent Crops\nHeterogeneous agricultural areas\n\nArable Land is land under a rotation system used for annually harvested plants and fallow lands. The land is permanently or not irrigated. It includes cereals, oil seed plants, vegetables, beets, fodder and flooded crops such as rice and other inundated croplands.\nPermanent crops are surfaces that are not under a rotation system but last for many seasons and need not to be replanted after harvest. Included are ligneous crops of standard cultures for fruit production such as extensive fruit orchards, olive groves, chestnut groves, walnut groves, shrub orchards such as vineyards and some specific low-system orchard plantation, espaliers and climbers. In the case of irrigated permanent crops, the qualification of irrigation prevails over permanent, thus, all the irrigated permanent crops are classified as 2.1.1.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land.\nHeterogeneous agricultural areas comprise surfaces where several categories are mixed. This may be either annual crops associated with permanent crops on the same parcel or annual crops cultivated under forest trees. Moreover, also combinations of annual crops, meadows and/or permanent crops mixed with natural vegetation or natural areas belong to this class.\nSpecific decision rules have been stabilised to distinct different types of heterogeneous agricultural areas:\n\nAnnual crops associated or in mosaic with permanent crops (vineyards, olives groves and non-irrigated fruits trees) in parcels &lt; 0.5 has. →2.3.1.0 Annual crops associated with permanent crops.\nMosaic or association of arable land and permanent crops in parcels &lt; 0.5 has. →2.3.2.0 Complex cultivation patterns.\nMix of arable land and pastures → 2.3.2.0 Complex cultivation patterns.\nCrops (annual/permanent/irrigated/non-irrigated) and mosaic of crops and pastures in mosaic or invaded by natural vegetation (agricultural area &gt; 75% and presence of parcels) → 2.3.3.0 Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation.\nAgro-forestry landscapes in specific locations → 2.3.4.0 Agro-forestry.\n\nThis category includes:\n\n2.1 Arable land\n\n2.1.1 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land\n\n2.1.1.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land\n\n\n2.1.2 Greenhouses\n\n2.1.2.0 Greenhouses\n\n\n\n2.2 Permanent crops\n\n2.2.1 Vineyards, fruit trees and berry plantations\n\n2.2.1.0 Vineyards, fruit trees and berry plantations\n\n\n2.2.2 Olive groves\n\n2.2.2.0 Olive groves\n\n\n\n2.3 Heterogeneous agricultural area\n\n2.3.1 Annual crops associated with permanent crops\n\n2.3.1.0 Annual crops associated with permanent crops\n\n\n2.3.2 Complex cultivation patterns\n\n2.3.2.0 Complex cultivation patterns\n\n\n2.3.3 Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation\n\n2.3.3.0 Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation\n\n\n2.3.4 Agro-forestry\n\n2.3.4.0 Agro-forestry (Mediterranean Areas)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1.0 Arable Irrigated and Non-Irrigated Land\nThis class includes the following land cover/land use types: non-irrigated arable land; irrigated arable land and rice fields; and complex patterns of irrigated and non-irrigated arable land.\n\n\nClass 2.1.1.0 Type A: Non-Irrigated Arable Land\n\n\nDefinition\nAll kind of crops like cereals, legumes, fodder crops, root crops and fallow land. Includes flower and tree (nurseries) cultivation and vegetables (e.g. asparagus), whether open field or under plastic sheets. Includes market gardening and aromatic, medicinal and culinary plants.\n\n\n\nNon-irrigated arable land: Rapeseed in Germany. Credits: M.

Most of the crops cannot be cultivated without an artificial water supply.\nUse of permanent irrigation infrastructure (irrigation channels, drainage network, irrigation ponds). This class includes also rice fields and irrigated fruits trees and vineyards in Mediterranean region. Irrigated arable land is restricted to Mediterranean areas, except clear areas with irrigated permanent infrastructures in other regions (such as Po river valley or Danube plain in Romania). The delimitation of Mediterranean will be based on biogeographic regions cartography.\nThis type includes:\n\nTraditional irrigated arable land with permanent irrigation infrastructure. Traditional irrigation areas located in fertile alluvial soils alongside the main Mediterranean rivers. These areas also include intensively or extensively managed fruit trees.\n\n\n\n\n\nIrrigation channel in Osmaniye (Turkey). Credits:“Osmaniye irrigation” by Ozgurmulazimoglu - Own work.

Full irrigation is needed to maintain these crops (e.g. orange trees, lemon trees, peach trees, etc.). Irrigated strawberries fields intensively managed. Intensively irrigated vineyards in Mediterranean region. In many cases associated to artificial irrigations ponds. Well represented in Southern Spain.

The interpretation is done according to FAO (2000) with tree cover &gt;10%, MMU of 0.5 ha and trees able to reach 5 m height in-situ at maturity. Young natural stands and all plantations established for forestry purposes, which have yet to reach a crown density of 10% or tree height of 5 m, are also included as forest. These areas normally are part of the forest area although temporarily unstocked because of human intervention or natural reasons but which are expected to revert to forest.\nForest further comprises:\n\nnurseries and seed orchards that constitute an integral part of the forest;\nforest roads;\ncleared tracts &lt; 0.5 ha;\nfirebreaks and other small open areas &lt; 0.5 ha;\nforest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas with an area of more than 0.5 ha and width of more than 10 m (which goes beyond the FAO Forest definition of 20 m);\nplantations primarily used for forestry purposes, including rubber wood plantations and cork oak stands.\n\nLand predominantly used for agricultural practices is excluded. Excluded is also land with:\n\neither a crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of 5-10% of trees able to reach a height of 5m at maturity in situ;\na crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than 10% of trees not able to reach a height of 5m at maturity in situ (e.g. dwarf or stunted trees);\nshrub or bush cover of more than 10 percent is not accounted as Forest.\n\nThe differentiation between broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest is in accordance with CLC interpretation guideline and HR Forest definition.\nBroadleaved forest: Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where broadleaved species predominate and represent more than 75% of the pattern.\nConiferous forest: Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where coniferous species predominate and represent more than 75% of the pattern.\nMixed forest: Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where neither broadleaved nor coniferous species predominate. The share of coniferous or broad-leaved species does not exceed 75% in the canopy closure.\nThe definition of Woodland and Forest is mainly oriented along aggregated EUNIS habitat classes.\nForest type interpretation might be problematic in locations with sunny slopes or in hilly regions with shady slopes.\nFire breaks will be classified according to their current land covers.\nThis category includes:\n\n3.1 Broadleaved forest\n\n3.1.1 Natural & semi-natural broadleaved forest\n\n3.1.1.0 Natural & semi-natural broadleaved forest\n\n\n3.1.2 Highly artificial broadleaved plantations\n\n3.1.2.0 Highly artificial broadleaved plantations\n\n\n\n3.2 Coniferous forest\n\n3.2.1 Natural & semi natural coniferous forest\n\n3.2.1.0 Natural & semi natural coniferous forest\n\n\n3.2.2 Highly artificial coniferous plantations\n\n3.2.2.0 Highly artificial coniferous plantations\n\n\n\n3.3 Mixed forest\n\n3.3.1 Natural & semi natural mixed forest\n\n3.3.1.0 Natural & semi natural mixed forest\n\n\n3.3.2 Highly artificial mixed plantations\n\n3.3.2.0 Highly artificial mixed plantations\n\n\n\n3.4 Transitional woodland and scrub\n\n3.4.0 Transitional woodland and scrub\n\n3.4.0.0 Transitional woodland and scrub\n\n\n\n3.5 Lines of trees and scrub\n\n3.5.0 Lines of trees and scrub\n\n3.5.0.0 Lines of trees and scrub\n\n\n\n3.6 Damaged forest\n\n3.6.0 Damaged forest\n\n3.6.0.0 Damaged forest\n\n\n\n\n\n3.1.1.0 Natural & Semi Natural Broadleaved Forest\nDefinition:\nThis type of forest comprises the tree species Fagus (EUNIS G1.6), deciduous or semi-deciduous thermophiles types like Quercus species and Carpinus orientalis, Castanea sativa or Ostrya carpinifolia (EUNIS G1.7).

    "text": "4 Grassland\n\nThe grassland classes are areas dominated by grassy vegetation of two kinds –managed pastures and (semi-) natural (extensively managed) grasslands3. Generally grasses (basically graminacea plants but can include tall forbs, rushes and sedges, mosses and lichens) covers more than 30% of the soils (EUNIS description), called below Crown Cover Density (C.C.D.).\nAccording to Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive, European natural grasslands are limited to alpine meadows (as Alpine, Pyrenean and Oro-Iberian grasslands) and other located grasslands.\nIn this sense, MAES level 2 natural grasslands are considered as natural and semi-natural grasslands and managed grasslands are agricultural grasslands. The main characteristics of agricultural grassland are the high human influence, basically cultivation and visible parcel structure in EO data.\nSemi-natural grasslands are frequently associated with trees and scrubs. These grasslands should be managed to maintain their grass coverage, basically by cutting out scrubs manually or mechanically. The combination of trees and grasslands is also present in many locations in Europe (in alluvial areas; in wooded hay meadows; due forest clearing, etc.). Dehesas and other wooded pastures, as Fennoscandinavian wooded pastures, are included in MAES Croplands class (agroforestry systems located in South Western Europe) or woodland and forest (in the case of forest pastures).\nThis category includes:\n\n4.1 Managed grassland\n\n4.1.0 Managed grassland\n\n4.1.0.0 Managed grassland\n\n\n\n4.2 Natural & semi natural grassland\n\n4.2.1 Semi-natural grassland\n\n4.2.1.0 Semi-natural grassland\n\n\n4.2.2 Alpine and sub-alpine natural grassland\n\n4.2.2.0 Alpine and sub-alpine natural grassland\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.0.0 Managed Grassland\nDefinition:\nManaged grasslands are considered intensively managed areas for the production of grass. From a land use point of view, in the case of these agricultural grasslands, grass is a crop in the same way as cereals or others. Managed grasslands could be divided into improved and semi-improved grasslands according to their management.\nAgricultural grasslands occupy huge areas in the lowlands of the European plain and in United Kingdom and Ireland, where they have a longer growing season due to climatic conditions, leaving dryer areas for arable crops. In many areas, arable land and agricultural grasslands are mixed.\nThis category corresponds to 231 Corine class (Pastures). According to the statistical analysis of Corine Land Cover 2006 data, pastures (231 classes) occupied 66% of more than 60.000.000 ha considered as grasslands (classes 231-pastures- and 321 –natural grasslands-).\nThe main characteristics of an ideally improved agricultural grassland farmland are 4\n\nThe grass farmland is dominated by selected grasses, especially perennial, and the crop is very dense. In early spring, the grassland is often fertilized by the farmer. These grass farmland areas are chlorophyll rich almost all year long and do not contain or contain very little dead biomass.\nIntensive cutting and grazing is done during the grass growing season (usually from April to September).\nThe grass could be cut and preserved for winter feeding. The grass for silage must be harvested in an optimum moment.\nSome farmers spread the grass by mower to achieve a better wilt, with the objective to remove excessive moisture for silage. This process could generate rows in the land due to accumulation of grasses. In many cases, this makes grasses undistinguishable from arable land using remote sensing techniques.\nFertilizers are applied.\nAgricultural grassland could be reseeded.\nUsually there are farm buildings (silages; covered yards; stables, etc.) around.\nOften/mainly used for grazing.\nImproved grassland could be included in rotation. In many countries and in European regulations (as EC Regulation 796/2004 related to EU agricultural policy) an area is considered as “permanent grassland” if the land is covered by grasses during at least five years.\n\nPer definition, there is no tree or scrub presence in improved grasslands\nIn between the intensively used grass farmland or in specific regions (as the bocage landscape in France), there can be plots of less intensive or extensive grassland, e.g. mowed only once a year. This type of grasslands (lowland and mountain hay meadows) could be considered as semi-improved grasslands (prairie in France; prado in Spain). Like in mountain alpine meadows, the percentage of wild floral species can increase. These grasslands can content trees and scrubs, especially trees walls around the parcels.\n\n\n\nManaged (improved) grasslands in Friesland (The Netherlands). Credit: European Union, 2012.

Alonso\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic representation of managed (semi-improved) grasslands\n\n\nManaged grasslands are discriminated from arable land using Landsat and VHR images, specific color and structure patterns (arable land parcels are generally more angular in shape than pastures and the texture is smooth) and the identification of cultivation tracks, but a certain grade of confusion between two classes is expected. Arable land, in Continental; Mediterranean and Nordic environments, typically appears on flat lowland soils with clay / fine sediment and few blocks. They are therefore generally more angular in shape than pastures and the texture is smooth.\n\n\n\nManaged grassland in Scandinavia. Borders to arable land. SPOT-5 image.* (*1/2/3 Band Combination).

Here are also included marginal grasslands: abandoned crop invaded by grasses; areas near roads and other infrastructures; abandoned dumping sites, etc.\nSemi natural grasslands include both dry grasslands and mesic grasslands:\n\nDry Grasslands: The EUNIS definition of dry grassland is: “Well drained or dry lands dominated by grass or herbs, mostly not fertilized and with low productivity. Included are [Artemisia] steppes. Excluded are dry Mediterranean lands with shrubs of other genera where the shrub cover exceeds 10%; these are listed as garrigue (F6)6.”\n\n\nThe Annex I of Habitat Directive considers diverse grassland types as dry grasslands, from calcareous grasslands of central and western Europe, to steppes in Pannonic region or pseudo-steppes in Mediterranean areas. In all cases, these are grasslands located in less fertile soils, and are extensively managed (not ploughed and rarely fertilized) and used for livestock grazing. In Annex I this type of grasslands are considered as semi-natural.\nIn the Mediterranean Region, dry grasslands are considered by the Annex I of Habitat Directive as pseudo-steppes. They are characterized by their loss of greenness in summer-time and are devoted to livestock grazing. In Hungary and other countries we find steppes grasslands (known here as puszta), as part of the dry grasslands. Pannonian steppes are flat alluvial plains dominated by herbaceous plants extensively managed and strongly transformed by agriculture. Turkey is also dominated by the Eurasian steppe (Central Anatolia steppe; Easter Anatolia Montane Steppe and Ponto-Sarmatic steppes in the Black Sea region). Semi-natural dry grasslands are also present in salt steppes and in gypsum steppes across Europe. Mediterranean salt steppes (Limonietalia); Iberian gypsum vegetation (Gypsophiletalia) and Pannonic salt steppes and salt marshes are also considered as semi-natural grasslands. Nordic alvar grasslands are also included here. These grasslands are located in dry calcareous and limestone bedrocks, covered by snow in winter and subject to strong winds. Regularly clearing is necessary to avoid scrubs. Coastal grasslands as machairs (specific coastal old landscape present in dunes in western Ireland and Scotland) dominated by grasses are also included.\nIn the case of steppes (Anatolian steppe) and Mediterranean pseudo-steppes (dry Mediterranean grasslands), grasses and grass-like plants are mixed with patches of rocks and/or sparsely vegetated areas. These habitats (especially Anatolian steppes) are characterized by low biomass due to dry conditions and poor soils. In many cases these steppes suffer for over-grazing and erosion7. As results, especially during summer time, it is not feasibly the distinction using EO data between areas covered by grasses (MAES class 4. Grassland) and rocks and areas with sparsely vegetation (MAES class 6. Sparsely vegetated land). In this case has been adopted the concept of steppes and pseudo-steppes as an edaphic climax habitat dominated by grasses and grass-like plants but with a high presence of sparsely vegetated areas. In this sense, generalization rules are applied (inclusion as grassland patches of low vegetation biomass) in order to avoid an excessive mapping fragmentation.\nDry grassland in Atlantic and Continental regions are restricted to very located sites affected by poor soils conditions such as calcareous dry grasslands in Western Germany, grasslands located in chalk cliffs in Denmark, grassland located in karstic regions in the Balkans or Nordic alvars8.\n\n\n\nDry grassland with trees on the Franconian Alb (juniper heathland), Germany.

Palacios\n\n\n\nMesic Grasslands: The EUNIS definition of mesic grasslands (E2) is: “Lowland and montane mesotrophic and eutrophic pastures and hay meadows of the boreal, nemoral, warm-temperate humid and mediterranean zones. They are generally more fertile than dry grasslands (E1), and include sports fields and agriculturally improved and reseeded pastures”. In EUNIS habitat classification9, the habitats are separated according the presence of water: waterlogged (the water table at or above ground level for at least half of the year), permafrost (habitats where the soil is at a temperature of less than 0oC throughout the year) and other (always dry; mesic, moist or humid; only seasonally wet; regularly but infrequently flooded or occasionally flooded by extreme weather conditions but which are free-draining; wet but not waterlogged; permanent snow and ice.). Here we consider mesic grasslands as mesic and moist or humid grasslands. The separation between mesic grasslands and wetlands is that the latter are waterlogged or frequently flooded.\n\n\nTaken into account Annex I Habitat Directive and EUNIS classification following grasslands types are included here:\n\nSemi-natural humid meadows: wet pastures (including riverine meadows), Mediterranean alluvial meadows and Northern boreal alluvial meadows.\nMesophile grassland not included in 4.1.0.0 Managed grasslands, including abandoned hay meadows.\n\n\n\n\nSpontaneous grassland in Bieszczday district (Poland).

    "text": "5 Heathland and Scrub\n\nHeathland and scrub is divided into two classes depending on whether the shrubby vegetation is evergreen and adapted to water loss (Sclerophyllous vegetation) or not (Moors and heathland).\nMoors and heathland appears in both temperate and frigid zones. Areas with heath and dwarf scrub vegetation adheres to the class 5.1.1.0 Heathland and moorlands. Areas dominated by brush woods and bush-like forest adheres to the class 5.1.2.0 Other scrub land.\nSclerophyllous vegetation appears in Mediterranean region.\nThis category includes:\n\n5.1 Heathland and Moorland\n\n5.1.0.

In Mediterranean areas, rain is concentrated in spring and autumn and red colors in scrubs are not rare as is the case.\nMethodological Advice:\n\nSometimes is complicate to distinguish this class from the forested areas, as the colours in the SPOT image are quite similar (sometimes the only difference is density). Therefore, auxiliary information is necessary to support a correct interpretation and delineation.\nUse of CLC class 3.2.3 as information source.\nUse HRL Forests to detect the trees, which can be potentially, class 5.2.0.0 Sclerophyllous vegetation.\nFinal detailed delineation and identification using computer assisted visual interpretation."

    "section": "7 Wetland",
    "text": "7 Wetland\n\nAccording to Article 1.1 of the Ramsar Convention25 (1971), wetlands are: “areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters”. This MAES class refers only to inland freshwater/saline wetlands.\nInland wetlands are predominantly water-logged specific plant and animal communities supporting water regulation and peat-related processes. This class includes natural or modified mires, bogs and fens, as well as peat extraction sites26 (MAES). Surfaces of temporary water are included in wetlands. According EUNIS guidelines (see table below), water-logged means the presence of the water table at or above ground level for at least half of the year.\nAdaptation of water interpretation in EUNIS27 and related RZ classes\n\n\n\n\n\nA decision criteria tree is established to clarify guideline distinctions between CODE Level 4 classes as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis category includes:\n\n7.1 Inland wetlands\n\n7.1.1 Inland marshes\n\n7.1.1.0 Inland marshes\n\n\n7.1.2 Peat bogs\n\n7.1.2.1 Exploited peat bog\n7.1.2.2 Unexploited peat bog\n\n\n7.2 Coastal wetlands\n\n7.2.1 Salt marshes\n\n7.2.1.0 Salt marshes\n\n\n7.2.2 Salines\n\n7.2.2.0 Salines\n\n\n7.2.3 Intertidal flats\n\n7.2.3.0 Intertidal flats\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.0 Inland Marshes\nDefinition:\nInland wetlands without a direct connection to the open ocean with significant content of water, which is influenced by a certain seasonal fluctuation.\nThis category corresponds to 411 CORINE Land Cover class (Inland marshes). Both inland freshwater marshes and inland salt marshes are included in this class. They are created where saline ground water rises to the surface, or in endorheic basins.\nInland marshes appear with or without a vegetation coverage. The coverage usually consists of reeds. Reed is a common name for several tall, grass-like plants of wetlands and rivers. They are all members of the order Poales: Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Sparganiaceae, Typhacea or Restionaceae.\nReed in marshes groups basically two types of plants:\n\nSedges (Cyperaceae family) are monocotyledon plants with solid and triangular stems; 3-ranked leaves; with flowers, and lenticular or triangular fruits. Sedges are common in wet habitats, including marshes, and in tundra habitats.\nRushes (Juncaceae family) are monocotyledon plants with solid and mostly round stems; few leaves, only basal or reduced to sheaths; with flowers and fruits in capsules. Rushes are common in wet habitats.\n\nIf not covered by vegetation: basically mud areas and/or waterlogged grasses and grass-like plants will be mapped.\nInland salt marshes without vegetation are located predominantly in Pannonic region (Pannonic salt steppes), Turkey, in Mediterranean specific locations and in endorheic basins across Europe.\nThis category includes:\n\nMarshes (freshwater or salt) with or without vegetation (reeds) coverage.\nAreas where reeds are harvested.\nReed covered wetland along river sides\nIn Nordic conditions: includes non-grazed/mowed and non-peat producing wetlands. These areas normally have a vegetation of tall grasses and sedges.\nAreas flooded at least six months a year with low or no vegetation.\nGrasslands highly wet or flooded at least six months a year.\nBare soils as results of previous presence of water will be also included within this category.\nIt will be taken into account that the Baltic Sea has only brackish coastal waters, which qualify for inland freshwater marshes.\nLimestone mires.\nFloating vegetation.\nReed beds in saline marshes with coverage less than 30%.\n\nThis category excludes:\n\nFloating aquatic vegetation (species such as Nuphar spp., Nymphaea spp., Potamageton spp. and Lemna spp.) is not considered as reeds and is included in 8.2. Lakes and reservoirs or 8.4 Sea and ocean.\nGrassland highly wet or flooded less than six months a year → 4.1.0.0 / 4.2.1.x Managed or semi natural grassland.\nRice fields → 2.1.1.0 Arable land.\nReeds mixed with trees (&gt; 5m) in rivers banks → 3.x.x.x Woodland and forest.\nOpen water ≥ 0.5 ha in wetland areas (class 8.2.1.0 Natural lakes).\nMesic/moist grasslands → 4.1.0.0 / 4.2.1.x Managed or semi natural grassland\nMarine wetlands such as salt marshes or salines → 7.2.x.x Coastal wetlands\nMires with more than 30% of tree cover density are considered as 3.0.0.0 Woodland and forest.\nInland exploited salines and extraction of sodium minerals in salt marshes, salt lakes or other locations → 1.3.1.0 Mineral extraction, dump and construction sites.\nShrub along river sides and on river banks (may include small patches of reeds with area &lt; 0.5 Ha) where neither climax tree-like forest formations nor grassland is detected (mainly located in areas of Mediterranean and continental climates with a summer season with warm-temperate & low precipitation) → 34.1.0 Transitional woodland and shrub.\n\nAttributes:\n\nN/A \n\n\n\n\nInland freshwater marshes in Tablas de Daimiel Natura 2000 Site (Central Spain).

Therefore the position in the terrain is used for guidance. Areas directly adjacent to bigger rivers or lakes are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes when visual interpretation is insufficient. This is because of lower chances of peat production when oxygen from flowing water is supplied to the ecosystem as opposed to ecosystems adjacent to standing water.\nNon-peat producing wetlands with a low-growing vegetation of grasses and sedges are generally grazed/mowed. These areas are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes.\nNon-grazed/mowed and non-peat producing wetlands normally have a vegetation of tall grasses and sedges and are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes. Temporarily flooded areas with low grasses and sedges are included in 4.2.1.0 Semi-natural grassland (located in mesic environments).\n\nMethodological Advice:\n\nMain identification will be based on CORINE Land Cover class 4.1.1 and Soils Map of Europe.\nThe existing knowledge on locations of large inland salines (Southern Europe, Pannonian Region or Turkey) will be taken into account and their surrounding ecosystems will be analyzed in order to detect possible occurrences of salines in class 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes.\nThe dividing line between the wetland and water classes is difficult to define without the contribution of images of different dates during the same year (in order to take into account the seasonality). The HRL Water/Wetland Layers may help to identify the boundaries between those two classes, but it should be noted that the pixel size of HR Layers is 20m and the production is based on the analysis of imagery corresponding to different years (2006-2009-2012-2018), not to different seasons.\nOther important datasets to detect these boundaries are Natura 2000 Network and Wetland Ramsar Sites databases. They are particularly relevant in the Mediterranean area and are highly recommended to use in the detection of Wetland Areas and Areas of Special Concern.\nAny available ancillary or in-situ data sources will also be used.\n\n\n7.1.2.1 Exploited Peat Bog\nDefinition:\nOpen exploited peat producing wetlands that are not greatly affected by lakes, sea water or water from water courses. Exploited peat bogs are characterized by linear trench and parcel structure.\n\n\n\nExploited peat bog in Roscommon (Ireland).

Credit imagery: Lantmäteriet\n\n\nIn low lying areas or local depressions complex mire types include areas of open peat, small ponds and streaks of mosses/heath vegetation.\nMethodological Advice:\n\nCORINE Land Cover class 4.1.2 (Peatbogs) as indication.\nNational supporting map data: vegetation map, topographical map, land cover map, Nature 2000 habitat map.\nSupporting remote sensing data: other satellite data, national aerial orthophotos (often available as WMS-service), Google earth.\nOther supporting data: HR layers, OpenStreetMap.\nComputer assisted visual interpretation of SPOT-5 data.\nIn Sweden classification is based on the Land survey Topographic map, where “wetland” and “open land” overlap. MAES wetland class is visually interpreted and adjusted manually. Adjustments of delineation are made only where obvious errors in ancillary are discernible in visual interpretation. When typical mire/peat structures cannot be seen in the image, it is difficult to determine if an area is peat producing or not. Therefore the position in the terrain is used for guidance. Areas directly adjacent to bigger rivers or lakes are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes when visual interpretation is insufficient. This is because of lower chances of peat production when oxygen from flowing water is supplied to the ecosystem as opposed to ecosystems adjacent to standing water. Grazed areas from LPIS that overlap wetland from the Topographic map are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes.\n\n\n7.2.1.0 Salt Marshes\nDefinition:\nCoastal salt marshes, according to the EUNIS habitat description, are dominated by sediments and salt-tolerant stands of vegetation, occurring on the extreme upper shore of sheltered coasts and periodically covered by high tides. According to the definition of CLC class 5.2, Marine waters are oceanic and continental shelf waters, bays and narrow channels including sea lochs, fiords and straits.\nThe class salt marshes includes according to EUNIS following habitat types: salt marsh drift lines, upper salt marshes, mid-upper salt marshes and saline brackish reed, rush and sedge beds and littoral sediments not included in 7.2.3 Intertidal flats or 6.2.1 Beaches and dunes.\nThe Estuaries class (8.3.2) includes marine waters not included in class 8.4.0 Sea and ocean or other lagoons and coastal wetlands classes.\nVegetated low-lying coastal areas, above the high-tide line, susceptible to flooding by seawater. Often in the process of filling in, gradually being colonized by salt tolerant plants (saline reed beds). Salt marshes also appear without or less vegetation coverage.\nOn the date of the EO data of reference these areas may be covered or not by water. In this category, the entire marsh area will be considered as class 7.2.1, regardless if it is covered by water or not on the date of the image.\n\n\n\nSalt marshes with salt tolerant plants in Camargue (Southern France).

Also water courses that cease to flow for part of the year, leaving a partially dry bed or water pools (EUNIS definition class C2.5) are included here. Different classes of temporary rivers are considered30: snowmelt and glacier meltwater; perched and semi-perched alluvial; and karstic non-permanent streams.\nPermanent running water courses occur throughout Europe, but are characteristic of well-watered areas as Atlantic and Continental biogeographical regions. In the Mediterranean region they are restricted to large water courses.\n\n\n\nNatural and semi-natural water course in Antalya Province (Southern Turkey). Credits: M.

Temporary separated water bodies belonging to the river system mainly correspond to riverine flooding covering old oxbows and other terrain depressions. In those areas, land may be covered with shallow, slow-moving floodwater for days or even weeks as exceptional situations. In these cases of temporary flooded areas, permanent land cover will be mapped (e.g. grasslands, wetlands or agricultural features).\n\n\n\nTemporary flood ponds in Danube River in Borcea (Romania).

This may be achieved using e.g. microservice architecture\n\n\nWhy:\nA modular structure is sought to ensure further development, and updates are possible. The possibility of substituting or adding modules in an IT solution will increase the lifespan of a solution and increase scalability\n\n\nConsequence:\nModular architecture of IT solutions is a requisite\n\n\nExample:\nIf the client specific IT solution has, for Example, grown its user base since the launch of the solution, then scaling up shall be possible at any time – scaling containers, vertically (more CPUs, RAM) and horizontally (more VMs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture 2 (Maintainability 2):\nIT solutions are to be Dockerized or similar\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe use of container technology is encouraged\n\n\nWhy:\nContainerization is crucial for building scalable IT solutions and container technology eases the work of moving IT solutions around the IT infrastructure making deployment easier to automate\n\n\nConsequence:\nIT solutions are to be deployed using Docker containers or similar\n\n\nExample:\nSoftware components of the client specific IT solution shall be provided as docker containers so that deployment is flexible with respect to hardware\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture 3 (Scalability 2):\nClient specific IT solutions must be able to interface with other IT solutions\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe IT deliverable must be able to be used in conjunction with other deliverables to form a composite solution\n\n\nWhy:\nTo make the most of the funds available the developed solutions should form part of an IT ecosystem making up a whole\n\n\nConsequence:\nIT deliverables must be equipped with documented APIs for interfacing with other IT applications\n\n\nExample:\nA client specific product, which can be used for extracting and manipulating data, should be accessible programmatically through e.g. well documented REST services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture 4:\nIT solutions should be cloud agnostic\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nIf the IT solution is built for cloud environments, measures must be taken to make the solution cloud agnostic.\n\n\nWhy:\nVendor lock-in must be avoided to remove vendor specific dependencies, making the IT solution easier to migrate to a different cloud vendor\n\n\nConsequence:\nIT solutions must minimize the usage of vendor specific functionality and non-standardized infrastructure\n\n\nExample:\nAn IT solution that makes use of serverless functions should be built in a way that allows for using another vendors serverless functionality with little or no changes in case of migrating from one platform to another"

Ideally the workflows delivered as scripts or similar. At a minimum documentation of how the workflows are to be set up is to be provided\n\n\nExample:\nA delivery that includes a web application, shall include description of the build process, such as the compilation of source code, packaging of the application, and deployment steps. This for instance could include details on the specific versions of tools used (e.g. Node.js, Docker etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 2:\nData sources to be supplied with deliverables\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nIT solutions which utilize data sources must supply the data sources\n\n\nWhy:\nTo ensure that the deliverable can be re-produced details are required on data sources used along with any enrichment which have been applied to the data source\n\n\nConsequence:\nData source location must be provided if data are publicly available. If data are not accessible to the CLMS, the data are to be provided as part of the deliverable\n\n\nExample:\nIf the software relies on a proprietary weather data API that is not publicly accessible, the data, or at least a sample dataset, should be provided with the delivery. If the API is publicly available, detailed instructions on how to access it (e.g., API keys, endpoint URLs) must be included\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 3:\nList of software used in development of IT solution to be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe software products which have been used in the development of the software are to be listed as part of the deliverable\n\n\nWhy:\nTo ensure that the IT solution can be further developed details are required of the software components/products that were used in the development\n\n\nConsequence:\nList of software development tools used in the production to be provided. Further for client specific developments the source code must also be provided\n\n\nExample:\nA system consisting of several building blocks, such as User Interface, backend, importer, and exporter modules, shall be provided with a list of software development tools, used for production of these building blocks and modules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 4:\nAutomation tool/scripts used in the production of the IT solution must be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nIT solutions which include automation scripts/workflows in the development must supply these scripts as part of the deliverable\n\n\nWhy:\nAutomation scripts used in development are viewed as part of the deliverable and are required for reproduction of the solution\n\n\nConsequence:\nAutomation scripts whether as stand-alone scripts or as a configuration of standard/commercial software must be provided as part of the deliverable\n\n\nExample:\nIf the IT deliverable includes an automatic backup that generates full backups in certain increments, then the automation scripts behind the backup generation must be provided as part of the deliverable, so that they could be recreated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 5:\nIf a solution includes outcomes of pre-executed algorithms the prerequisites for running the algorithms must be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nTo ensure reproducibility, the algorithms must be provided either as pseudo code or as source code\n\n\nWhy:\nThe foundation of the IT solution must be re-producible to ensure future enhancements are possible say if new insights/data become available also after the end of the contractual agreement\n\n\nConsequence:\nSupplier must as part of the deliverable also detail any algorithms which form the basis of the solution\n\n\nExample:\nA spatial product, providing a detailed pan-European wall to wall 10-meter spatial resolution raster product, that is based on a supervised classification of satellite image time-series. The supplier must provide a detailed description of the algorithm that was used for classifying satellite-imagery time-series"

    "text": "This manual guides users through creating technical documentation for the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service using Quarto. Quarto simplifies the process of writing professional documents in Markdown, and converting them into HTML and PDF for nice publishing. The manual covers basic Markdown writing, document rendering, as well a the review, and publication process of technical CLMS documents. It also describes the project folder structure, template usage, and common mistakes to avoid.\nIf you’re responsible for setting up the documentation repository, follow the steps in Adding Documentation to Your Project. Editors can skip this part and continue reading the manual to learn about editing and Markdown syntax.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nYou don’t need to be a programmer nor an expert to use Quarto. If you’ve ever written a document in Microsoft Word, you’ll be able to use Quarto with a bit of practice.\n\n\n\n\n\nThis section explains how your documentation project is organized and where to put your files. The structure ensures consistency, simplifies maintenance, and allows documents to be rendered correctly in both your local project and the central Technical Library.\nBelow is the standard folder layout you’ll see at the root of the DOCS/ directory in your project:\nDOCS/\n├── _meta/              # Scripts, config, and metadata (do not edit)\n├── includes/           # Quarto include files (do not edit)\n├── templates/          # Document templates (do not edit)\n├── theme/              # Styling definitions (do not edit)\n├── _quarto.yml         # Project-wide Quarto config\n├── CLMS_your-product-one_ATBD.qmd\n├── CLMS_your-product-one_ATBD-media/\n├── CLMS_your-product-two_PUM.qmd\n├── CLMS_your-product-two_PUM-media/\n├── ...\n└── CLMS_your-product-last_PUM.qmd\n\n\n\nYou simply need to add your own .qmd files in the DOCS/ directory.\nIf your document uses charts, screenshots, or diagrams, create a media folder with the same base name as your document and a -media suffix.\nExample:\nDOCS/\n├── CLMS_your-product-one_ATBD.qmd\n└── CLMS_your-product-one_ATBD-media/\n    └── figure1.png\nDo not modify the following folders: _meta/, includes/, templates/, theme/. These are managed centrally.\n\ntemplates/\nThis is where you’ll find ready-to-use .qmd templates. There are templates for two document types:\n\nATBD (Algorithm Theoretical Basis Document)\n\nPUM (Product User Manual)\n\nWhen you start a new document, copy the appropriate template from this directory. This ensures consistency in structure and formatting across all documents in the Technical Library.\n\nStyling and rendering will automatically reflect the structure and appearance defined by the central documentation project.\n\n\n\n\nTo preview the full rendered documentation from your project, use:\ngit docs-preview\nFor more details on previewing and validating, see the final chapter of this manual."

    "section": "2.1 Line Breaks and New Lines",
    "text": "2.1 Line Breaks and New Lines\nIn Markdown, how you break a line can affect how your text is displayed in the final document. Quarto follows standard Markdown behavior, so it’s important to understand the difference between soft and hard line breaks.\n\n2.1.1 Soft Line Break (Just Pressing Enter)\nWhen you press Enter once and start a new line in your text editor, Markdown does not create a visible line break in the output. Instead, it treats the two lines as part of the same paragraph.\nExample (input):\nThis is the first line\nand this is the second line.\nRendered output:\n    This is the first line and this is the second line.\nThis keeps your Markdown source tidy, but it won’t create new lines unless explicitly instructed\n\n\n2.1.2 Hard Line Break (Using  at End of Line)\nTo force a visible line break in Markdown, you must add two spaces at the end of a line or use a backslash \\. Quarto supports both, but using \\ is clearer and more explicit.\nThis is the first line.\\\nand this is the second line.\nRendered output:\n    This is the first line.\n    and this is the second line.\n\n\n2.1.3 Paragraph Break (Double Enter)\nIf you press Enter twice (i.e., leave a blank line between two lines), Markdown will treat the content as two separate paragraphs. This results in a larger vertical space between the lines in the rendered output.\nExample (input):\nThis is the first paragraph.\n\nThis is the second paragraph.\nRendered output:\n    This is the first paragraph.\n    This is the second paragraph.\nThis behavior is especially important when structuring readable documentation, separating ideas, or organizing content clearly.\n\n\n2.1.4 Summary\n\nUse Enter for a new line in your editor, but don’t expect a visible line break.\nUse \\ at the end of a line when you want to force a line break.\nUse double Enter (i.e., an empty line between paragraphs) to start a new paragraph with extra spacing."

Also, make sure the paragraph follows the list item without a blank line, or it may break the list.\n- This is the list item title.\n  This is a paragraph that belongs to the same list item.\n  It should be indented to align with the start of \"This is a paragraph...\"\n\n- Another item\n  With its own paragraph block.\n\n\n2.5.4 Single-Item List Rendering Issue\nWhen a list or sublist contains only one item, it can be incorrectly rendered in .docx or .pdf formats. In such cases, the item may appear in the wrong font or style.\nTo fix this, apply a custom style to the single list item. In the provided Word template, use the style named “NormalLine”.\nHere is how to apply it:\n- step 1        \n    - [step 1.1]{custom-style=\"NormalLine\"}\\\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\n\nThe custom-style attribute ensures the correct formatting.\nDon’t forget to include the backslash () at the end of the line to prevent unwanted spacing or breaks."

The following approaches work well in both HTML and DOCX outputs, including when converting to PDF.\n\n\n2.10.1 Without Captions\nYou can use a Markdown table to arrange images in multiple columns and rows:\n| ![](image1.png){width=120} | ![](image2.png){width=120} | ![](image3.png){width=120} |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| ![](image4.png){width=120} | ![](image5.png){width=120} | ![](image6.png){width=120} |\nThis creates two rows with three images each. Adjust the width as needed to fit your layout.\n\n\n\n2.10.2 With Captions\nTo add captions under each image, simply include a row of text below each row of images:\n| ![](img1.png){width=120} | ![](img2.png){width=120} | ![](img3.png){width=120} |\n|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|\n| Caption 1               | Caption 2               | Caption 3               |\n| ![](img4.png){width=120} | ![](img5.png){width=120} | ![](img6.png){width=120} |\n| Caption 4               | Caption 5               | Caption 6               |\nThis method keeps captions aligned with each image, and works across all output formats.\n\n⚠️ Note: Tables used for captions will show borders in DOCX and PDF outputs.

Quarto will automatically apply its default rendering format, which is sufficient in most cases.\nHowever, if you need to customize the rendering outputs (e.g. to apply a specific DOCX style), then you must define the format: field carefully.\nThese fields are required for correct rendering:\n\nformat: controls how your document is rendered (HTML, styled DOCX, PDF)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must include the pdf: default format in the YAML header.\nAlthough PDF is not rendered directly during this step, defining it here ensures compatibility with the automated rendering workflow later. Details are explained in the Rendering Documentation section.\n\n\nIf you override the format section, please follow these strict guidelines:\n\nOnly modify the format: block.\nYou must define all three output formats:\n\nhtml:\ndocx: (with reference-doc: pointing to the style template)\npdf:\n\n\nImproper modifications can break the rendering process locally or in the central Technical Library. To see correct examples of a fully-defined format block, refer to the template files in DOCS/templates/.\nHere’s a basic header you can use:\n---\ntitle: \"Product SHORT NAME\"\nsubtitle: \"Product full name\"\ndate: \"2022-10-06\"\nversion: 1.0\ntemplate-version: 1.0.0\nproduct-name: Product Name\ndescription: \"Product DESCRIPTION\"\n---\n\n3.3.1 Field Descriptions:\n\ntitle: The main title of the document (displayed in the rendered output).\nsubtitle: An optional second line of text under the title.\ndate: The publication or last updated date.\nversion: The version of your document (e.g. “1.0”, “v2.3-draft”).\ntemplate-version: Not rendered — this is a special internal field that helps keep track of which template was originally used. Do not remove or modify this field unless you’re updating the template version intentionally.\n\n\nThese fields must be filled in by the user.

It will look almost exactly like the final PDF because it uses the same styles and layout rules.\nThis is a great option when you want to quickly check how your document will look in PDF format — especially while you’re still editing the .qmd file.\nYou don’t need to change the order of output formats in the YAML header. Just click the black arrow next to the Render button in RStudio and select “Render MS Word” from the dropdown menu.\n\nAfter rendering, the .docx file will automatically open in your default DOCX editor (e.g., Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer).

However, this is typically handled automatically by the rendering workflow in the GitHub repository during the publishing process.\n\n💡 You do not need to render the entire library yourself. Just focus on rendering the file you are currently working on. This keeps things faster and easier to manage during editing.\n\n\n\n10.3.1 About the _quarto.yaml File\nThe _quarto.yaml file is a special configuration file that defines project-wide settings, including the default output folder — which is _site.\nWhen this file is present in the root of your project, RStudio (and Quarto) assumes you’re working in project mode. That means it tries to render the entire site, not just the file you’re editing.\nThis can cause a few issues during local editing:\n\nSlower preview performance\nRStudio sometimes doesn’t pick up the latest changes right away (likely due to caching)\nViewer pane might not display fresh output\n\nUnfortunately, this behavior isn’t clearly documented — but it can be confusing and frustrating.\n\n\n10.3.2 Recommended Setup for Efficient Editing\nTo avoid these issues, the repository includes a renamed config file: _quarto-not-used.yaml. This allows users to edit and preview individual files efficiently without triggering full-site rendering.\nBy default, this means:\n\nRStudio operates in “single file mode”\nOutput files (HTML, DOCX) are written directly next to the .qmd file (e.g. in products/)\n\n\n\n10.3.3 Rendering the Full Project\nWhen you need to preview or build the entire Technical Library locally:\n\nRename _quarto-not-used.yaml to _quarto.yaml\nRun:\n\n$ quarto render\nThis builds the full site into the _site/ folder as defined in the YAML config.\n\n⚠️ Working with _quarto.yaml in place during regular editing can work, but it may lead to slower performance or outdated previews in the Viewer pane.

    "text": "4.1 Use case: Grassland LC/LU changes and trends analysis in Natura 2000 sites\nEstablished under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, Natura 2000 is the world's largest ecological network of protected areas, a network of key breeding and resting places for rare and endangered species. In addition to the focus on species, the network also aims at protecting more than 200 different Natural habitat types. The network covers about 18% of the EU's land area throughout all 27 EU Member States. It is not a system of strict nature reserves from which all human activities would be excluded. While it includes strictly protected areas, most of the land remains privately owned and managed. EU Member States must ensure that the sites are managed in a sustainable manner to prevent significant impacts on species and habitats for which the sites have been designated. It is part of the policy strategy to conserve Europe's biodiversity and was established on the legal requirements of the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive.\nGrassland ecosystems are highly biodiverse and species-rich vegetation types, providing a range of ecosystem services. The selection of Natura 2000 sites mapped was prioritized on the basis of occurrence of 32 different grassland habitat types across Europe, as defined by Annex I of the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC).\nBased on a comparative assessment of the N2K product, reference years 2006, 2012 and 2018, LC/LU changes and trends were analysed within the selected Natura 2000 sites and their two km buffer zone.\nDue to the known strong decrease of grassland habitats, the focus of the analysis relied especially on semi-Natural and Natural grasslands, as they are vulnerable to different pressures such as intensification of agriculture and grassland management, land abandonment, shrub encroachment, afforestation, urbanisation and several more.\nThe assessment was based on the mapping of land cover/land use as well as changes between the three reference years 2006, 2012 and 2018 of the selected Natura 2000 sites, including a 2 km buffer zone around each site, to form the total N2K product coverage of around 631.820 km² across Europe.\nThe assessment of the Grassland Habitat Types concentrated on the grassland areas and its changes. LC/LU changes are associated with the following Land Cover Change Groups (LCGs), defined in close cooperation with representatives from DG ENV and EEA:\n\nUrbanisation\nDe-urbanisation\nAgricultural intensification\nAgricultural extensification\nAgricultural conversion to managed grassland\nAgricultural conversion to cropland\nAgricultural abandonment\nForest increase - Natural succession\nForest increase – Plantation\nTree encroachment\nDeforestation\nForest degradation\nRegeneration\nIntensification of grassland use\nExtensification of grassland use\nDecline of woody plants\nWoody plant encroachment\nShift of tree line\nColonization by marginal grasses\nExpansion of grassland\nGrassland degradation\nScrub encroachment\nScrub retreat\nSedimentation / Plant succession\nDrainage\nDeconstruction and reNaturation\nHydrological restoration\n\nThe mapped area covers a substantial part of the Natura 2000 sites and the European territory and includes, to different degrees, all MS and most Biogeographical Regions. Some biogeographical zones and MS are better represented than others and therefore the analysis should be read in the context of this representativeness.\nThe figure below (Distribution of Level 1 classes in the mapped N2K AoI (Natura 2000 sites and buffer zone) for the reference years 2006, 2012 and 2018.) gives an overview of the eight Level 1 classes, their area coverage and N2K AoI proportion for the three-time steps 2006, 2012 and 2018. The highest share is taken up by Woodland and forests, followed by Cropland and Grassland. Wetlands are by far the rarest class, followed by Water and Open spaces with little or no vegetation.\n\nA look at the changes between the time steps 2006 – 2012 and 2012 – 2018 shown in the figure below (Overview total gains and losses per Level 1 class in ha and % for the periods 2006-2012 and 2012-2018 on European Level) reveals high dynamics in the classes Urban and Grassland, both in total numbers and percentage share. The observation period 2006 – 2012 indicates a considerable high increase of Urban areas (2,64%) whereas Grasslands decreased to a similar total area but a lesser percentage. A percentual high loss was also experienced by Wetlands and Heathland and moorlands.\nThe period 2012 – 2018 is dominated by the high decrease of the Grassland class, with even 0,21 percentage points more than the previous period, and a high increase of Urban area, even though to a lesser extent than in 2006 – 2012.\nComparing the two periods of observation, the decrease of Cropland between 2006 and 2012 is compensated by an increase in the following six years. Both classes, Urban and Grassland, continued their trend in opposite directions. Heathland and moorlands as well as Wetlands continue to loose area, even if to a slower ratio than in the subsequent period. The Open spaces with little or no vegetation class has experienced a reverse trend from an area gain between 2006-2012 to area loss in 2012-2018. One reason behind this may be the recovery of landscape after fire events. The figure also shows the declining area of No Data areas which reached zero in 2018. Since this cannot be considered a real change but is only resulting from a significant improvement in satellite data availability, it appears without bar in the graph.\n\nThe figure below shows the most important pressures on grassland habitats for the 2012 – 2018 period. This helps to better understand the changes in the mapped area. The percentage of each pressure is related to the total area of changes.\nThe most prominent pressures are ‘Agricultural intensification’ (16%), Tree encroachment (16%) and ‘Agricultural conversion to cropland’ (14%) and followed by ‘Urbanization’ (13%). ‘Expansion of grassland’ (9%) remains the most important change process related to a grassland gain."

    "text": "4.2 Measuring the effectiveness of EU Member States efforts for protecting Natura 2000 grasslands\nIn addition to the previous general assessment, Copernicus Land Monitoring Service is helping to support and measure the effectiveness of EU Member States and their efforts for protecting the increasingly important Natura 2000 grasslands.\nWhen looking at the LC/LU inside the Natura 2000 sites, as compared to the 2 km buffer surrounding the sites, and as expected, the more anthropogenic land uses, such as urban and cropland, cover larger areas in the buffer zones as shown in the table below. In contrast, Natural and semi-Natural land cover is more abundant inside the sites. Grasslands are found to an almost equal extent in both areas because the class includes not only Natural and semi-Natural (species-rich) but also intensely managed (species-poor) grasslands, which are more comparable in their use to croplands.\nOverall, a continuous loss of grasslands can be observed, and the trend is visible both in the buffer zone and the sites themselves, even though it is to a lesser amount in the latter.\n\nOther key findings (shown in the table below) include:\n\nGrasslands showed a decline for two of the four different classes distinguished in the mapping. Managed grassland (class 4100) and Semi-Natural grassland with woody plants (class 4212) have the highest losses.\nAlpine areas (4220) as the only type being more or less stable.\nSemi-Natural grassland without woody plants (4211) experienced a gain for both reference periods.\n\n\nLooking at the data for Natura 2000 sites and buffer zones separately (Figure below), the grassland classes inside the Natura 2000 network can be seen to still be declining in area, apart from class 4211, which experienced slight gains in both periods, the reason for this most likely being land abandonment leading to shrub encroachment. In the buffer zone, classes 4100, 4212 and 4220 all decline more severely than inside the sites. The graph clearly shows once again that grassland cover seems overall to be subject to bigger changes outside Natura 2000 sites (i.e. in the buffer).\n\n\nThe N2K product allows us to recognise that good work is being done within Natura 2000 areas to lessen the decline of grasslands areas. However, it also tells us more work is required to protect these valuable areas, in particular with the continual monitoring of changing agricultural practices.\nThe Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (implemented by the European Environment Agency) is committed to the continual improvement of such monitoring schemes to address these challenges collectively. In particular, it is hoped that grasslands can not only be effectively preserved with N2K, but that the monitoring and assessment of biodiversity in line with the objectives of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2030 can also be achieved to the highest level. All of which will help ensure the continual protection of the vitally important Natura 2000 grasslands."

    "text": "5.3 Representativity analysis\nThe final selection of Natura 2000 sites depended to a large extent also on the satellite data availability for 2006 and 2012 in order to avoid data gaps as much as possible. That led to the fact that the mapped Natura 2000 sites are neither equally distributed across Europe nor equally representative of the Member States or the Biogeographical regions: the distribution of the selected sites with a high representation are in South, South-western, Central and Eastern Europe whereas the Nordic countries and the British and Irish Isles are underrepresented.\nMoreover, a considerable number of sites without designated grassland habitats and which were therefore not specifically selected for the mapping, still overlap with, or lie completely within the LC/LU mapping boundary (the designated AoI) that is defined by the outline of the selected N2K sites plus a 2 km buffer.\nThe boundaries of Member States with coastlines were extended 10km to the sea in order to assure full coverage of all the Natura 2000 sites chosen for the mapping. The additional area of coastal waters is included in every MS with marine area.\nIn a first assessment step, the number of sites per MS which are completely covered by the mapping area was compared to the total number of Natura 2000 sites of each MS.\nThe mapping area (Natura 2000 sites and buffer) includes sites which are completely covered, as well as some which are only partly covered by the N2K AoI. The number of completely mapped Natura 2000 sites was determined by the N2K LC/LU mapping boundaries. The intention is to show to what degree the Natura 2000 sites with designated grassland habitats of every MS are represented in the CLMS N2K mapping products.\nSome sites, however, where not counted as completely mapped, if the GIS operation identified parts of non-coverage. This is often the case along the coastline, where the sea area has been cut out of the N2K AoI even though the Natura 2000 boundary actually extends a bit further into the open water. Further, the area mapped in every MS (Natura 2000 sites + buffer) is compared and put into relation with the calculated area, which may also include a 10km buffer of coastal waters, if applicable.\nThe first part of the assessment indicates a considerable high representation of Natura 2000 sites (disregarding their designated habitat types) for Hungary (44,38%), Italy (38,04%) and Bulgaria (37,46%) and very low representation of Finland (0,32%), United Kingdom (0,96%) and Ireland (0,99%), with an EU average of 17,17%.\nWhen comparing the area of each MS national territory with the mapped area, Slovenia (42,19%) and Luxembourg (37,76%) as very small countries are at the top of the list but closely followed by large MS like Bulgaria (37,46%) and Spain (31,41%). Again, Finland (0,18%), the United Kingdom (0,33%) and Ireland (0,86%) are only covered to a fraction compared to the EU average of 13,52% (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Representativeness of CLMS N2K mapping for all Natura 2000 site types within each MS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember state (MS)\nNatura 2000 sites (total)\nNatura 2000 sites completely mapped\nShare of mapped sites\nTotal area mapped (km²)\nArea MS (km²)\n% of MS area\n\n\n\n\nAustria\n350\n53\n15.14%\n8295.83\n83927.63\n9.88%\n\n\nBelgium\n310\n51\n16.45%\n6152.43\n31349.53\n19.63%\n\n\nBulgaria\n339\n127\n37.46%\n40686.90\n113948.15\n35.71%\n\n\nCroatia\n779\n157\n20.15%\n13312.80\n75603.23\n17.61%\n\n\nCyprus\n63\n3\n4.76%\n440.94\n15931.60\n2.77%\n\n\nCzech Republic\n1153\n160\n13.88%\n8587.88\n78869.90\n10.89%\n\n\nDenmark\n384\n20\n5.21%\n2750.28\n71628.43\n3.84%\n\n\nEstonia\n567\n120\n21.16%\n12385.10\n62545.91\n19.80%\n\n\nFinland\n1859\n6\n0.32%\n683.41\n384010.79\n0.18%\n\n\nFrance\n1779\n394\n22.15%\n63840.30\n585899.90\n10.90%\n\n\nGermany\n5200\n767\n14.75%\n47540.00\n372524.70\n12.76%\n\n\nGreece\n446\n34\n7.62%\n12010.60\n236245.66\n5.08%\n\n\nHungary\n525\n233\n44.38%\n26189.30\n94022.25\n27.85%\n\n\nIreland\n604\n6\n0.99%\n786.51\n91139.82\n0.86%\n\n\nItaly\n2613\n994\n38.04%\n78436.60\n365392.96\n21.47%\n\n\nLatvia\n333\n29\n8.71%\n3418.80\n73070.45\n4.68%\n\n\nLithuania\n559\n61\n10.91%\n2565.31\n72943.46\n3.52%\n\n\nLuxembourg\n66\n20\n30.30%\n980.15\n2595.77\n37.76%\n\n\nMalta\n52\n3\n5.77%\n114.79\n1717.87\n6.68%\n\n\nNetherlands\n196\n9\n4.59%\n1918.43\n44292.10\n4.33%\n\n\nPoland\n984\n242\n24.59%\n45526.40\n326678.13\n13.94%\n\n\nPortugal\n166\n22\n13.25%\n10444.80\n113707.07\n9.19%\n\n\nRomania\n606\n105\n17.33%\n38392.70\n249883.33\n15.36%\n\n\nSlovakia\n683\n161\n23.57%\n9635.40\n49665.16\n19.40%\n\n\nSlovenia\n355\n80\n22.54%\n8637.47\n20473.70\n42.19%\n\n\nSpain\n1863\n569\n30.54%\n174763.00\n556466.17\n31.41%\n\n\nSweden\n4087\n352\n8.61%\n9476.23\n495428.75\n1.91%\n\n\nSwitzerland\n37\n3\n8.11%\n938.88\n41280.13\n2.27%\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n935\n9\n0.96%\n1078.16\n326416.02\n0.33%\n\n\nTOTAL\n27893\n4790\n17.17%\n629989.41\n5037658.58\n13.52%*\n\n\n\n²MS size is overestimated due to the sea buffer calculation. Since the Eastern European countries, which are not member of the EEA 39, are not included in the layer, the neighbouring countries were treated as sea and buffered with 10km into the neighbouring country.\n*Average taken from all MS. The percentage of comparing the sum of all calculated MS areas with the total mapped area would be roughly 8%.\nThe focus of the CLMS N2K mapping was put on sites with grassland habitats. These are considered as especially rich in biodiversity and face a declining trend in most parts of the Member States. Table 3 below gives an overview of the number of sites which contain at least one declared type of grassland type (according to the Natura 2000 Standard Data Forms) and its coverage by the LC/LU mapping.\nThe assessment of the representativeness of sites with grassland habitats produces a high number for Slovenia (71,64%), Croatia (57,97%) and Bulgaria (56,50%). A low representativeness of grassland habitats is found in Finland (1,85%), the United Kingdom (3,93%) and Ireland (6,76%). In some MS, also a considerable high number of sites with grassland habitats is partly mapped and, in some MS, the percentage of these sites which are not mapped at all is comparably high, e.g. Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands. Note that this table includes all sites which were listed in the year 2018 and the number of grassland sites may have been lower when the sites were chosen for the 2006-2012 mapping.\nGrassland sites:\n\nTable 3: Representativeness of Natura 2000 sites with grassland habitat types per MS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember State\nTotal\nNot Mapped\nPartly Mapped\nCompletely Mapped\n% of Completely Mapped Sites\n\n\n\n\nAustria\n199\n141\n19\n39\n19,60%\n\n\nBelgium\n263\n139\n75\n49\n18,63%\n\n\nBulgaria\n177\n28\n49\n100\n56,50%\n\n\nCroatia\n138\n41\n17\n80\n57,97%\n\n\nCyprus\n27\n24\n0\n3\n11,11%\n\n\nCzech Republic\n303\n161\n38\n104\n34,32%\n\n\nDenmark\n175\n132\n29\n14\n8,00%\n\n\nEstonia\n243\n85\n54\n104\n42,80%\n\n\nFinland\n271\n256\n10\n5\n1,85%\n\n\nFrance\n1103\n557\n219\n327\n29,65%\n\n\nGermany\n3001\n1761\n602\n638\n21,26%\n\n\nGreece\n120\n72\n20\n28\n23,33%\n\n\nHungary\n410\n110\n76\n224\n54,63%\n\n\nIreland\n74\n68\n1\n5\n6,76%\n\n\nItaly\n1932\n638\n343\n951\n49,22%\n\n\nLatvia\n130\n99\n7\n24\n18,46%\n\n\nLithuania\n179\n112\n15\n52\n29,05%\n\n\nLuxembourg\n48\n16\n14\n18\n37,50%\n\n\nMalta\n5\n1\n4\n0\n0,00%²\n\n\nNetherlands\n100\n79\n14\n7\n7,00%\n\n\nPoland\n522\n237\n74\n211\n40,42%\n\n\nPortugal\n83\n49\n12\n22\n26,51%\n\n\nRomania\n197\n77\n44\n76\n38,58%\n\n\nSlovakia\n437\n219\n84\n134\n30,66%\n\n\nSlovenia\n67\n7\n12\n48\n71,64%\n\n\nSpain\n1152\n346\n316\n490\n42,53%\n\n\nSweden\n1480\n1101\n79\n300\n20,27%\n\n\nSwitzerland\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n178\n165\n6\n7\n3,93%\n\n\nTOTAL\n13014\n6721\n2233\n4060\n31,20%\n\n\n\n² Four sites were chosen for LC/LU mapping but due to spatial query settings, those were registered as “partly mapped”. Manual checks produced a coverage of 4 out of the 5 grasslands sites, resulting in an 80% grassland site coverage.\nSwitzerland as non-EU state is listed in the table because of three Emerald sites there located which are included in the N2K product however it was not included in the representativeness assessment. The Emerald network have some similarities to Natura 2000 network but do not follow exactly the same criteria.\nThe low numbers of some MS in the two sections of the representativeness assessment are seen as an important indicator for how the results related to these MS can be assessed. In these cases, a projection of the results which derived from a small number of sites, may not represent the situation on the national level.\nIn conclusion, the mapped Natura 2000 sites are neither equally distributed across Europe nor equally representative of the MS or the Biogeographical regions. The distribution of the selected sites with a high representation are in South, South-western, Central and Eastern Europe whereas the Nordic countries and the British and Irish Isles are underrepresented."

    "text": "5.4 Natura 2000 boundary changes and the impact in the CLMS N2K product Area of Interest (AoI)\nThe AoI for mapping the LC/LU was setup, changed and extended throughout the evolution of the CLMS N2K product, in three different phases:\nFirst, during the initial setup of the N2K AoI under the GIO project phase (GMES Initial Operation Phase in 2014) a selection of Natura 2000 grassland-rich sites (representing five grassland habitats types, namely, 6210, 6240, 6250, 6510 and 6520) as identified in Annex I of the Habitats Directive was used;\nA list of Natura 2000 sites was proposed by EC DG ENV on the basis of their representativeness and relative importance for the given habitat types. The information for selecting sites on the basis of the above criteria has been taken from the Natura 2000 sites’ Standard Data Forms in the most recent version of the EU-wide Natura 2000 database at the time;\nBased on this list of Natura 2000 site codes the corresponding site boundaries were extracted from the Natura 2000 Database (version: Natura 2000 v2013). This led to an AOI area of around 150.800 km²;\nA GIS- and EO data analysis was then performed to:\n\nBuffer the Natura 2000 sites by 2km, which increased the N2K AOI area to around 252.600 km²)\nIdentify existing VHR satellite coverage for the reference years 2006 +/- 1 year (with extension to +/- 2 years for gap-filling) and 2012 +/- 2 years within defined seasonal windows, so that in combination they reach &gt; 80% coverage of the full (buffered) N2000 site size (i.e. in the same areas, for both time steps). This reduced the AOI to around 162.600 km² - 173.800 km²\n\nThe finally mapped N2K product during the GIO Phase covered 160.443 km².\nIn the second production phase (started in 2016) the N2K AOI was enlarged. Additional Natura 2000 sites were selected, now based on a list of 32 different Annex 1 grassland habitat types as defined under the Habitats Directive. The additional Natura 2000 site boundaries were again taken from the Natura 2000 Database (this time from version: end2015). The buffer was applied to the newly selected sites and minor adaptations to the N2K AoI were made to correct imprecisions and omission errors. This changed the AoI size and geometry in a way that:\n\nMissing 2km buffers were included, for mainly buffers around islands were missing\nWrongly clipped buffers of selected N2K sites were included\nExisting gaps between N2K sites shapefile and EEA39 member states boundary shapefile were filled. Regarding water areas, those gaps over water appeared if EEA39 boundaries do not coincide with N2K site boundaries along coastlines and had also to be corrected and included\nMinor gaps and spikes between the AoIs of the first and second phases were corrected and included\nSmall angles (&lt;20°) were checked and corrected where feasible.\n\nIn the end of the second production phase, the existing 160.443km² were complemented by 471.377 km² leading to the N2K product covering 631.820 km² for the reference years 2006 and 2012.\nIn the third production phase (started in 2020 and finished in May 2021) the N2K product is updated to the reference year 2018, including the change layer 2012-2018. No changes were applied to the geographic coverage of the product.\nThe option taken for the N2K product was to have a stable AoI so that the change mapping exercise could be done within the same area and that the derived statistics were not affected by changing AoI’s.\nAs can be seen from the above “history” of the N2K AoI creation process, there were several input data sets used as well as several geospatial corrections applied to generate the currently used N2K coverage of 631.820km². As stated above there are several factors which prevent a 1:1 relation between the N2K AoI and Natura 2000 site boundaries:\n\nDifferent Natura 2000 database versions were applied to generate the unbuffered N2K site selection (version Natura 2000 v2013 and later version end2015). Changes in the yearly updated Natura 2000 site definitions were not adapted for already mapped N2K sites (Figure 4)\nN2K AoI adaptations to achieve a technically “clean” dataset may have led to deviations from a strict 2km buffer zone around each selected Natura 2000 site.\nThe availability of archived VHR satellite data for the reference years 2006 and 2012 required a threshold to produce N2K LC/LU information also for Natura 2000 sites covered by up to a minimum of 80% satellite data.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Example of diverging Natura 2000 site boundaries (red 2015 version, blue 2019 version, grey N2K product coverage incl. the 2km buffer)\n\n\nAlso, due to the buffering of the Natura 2000 sites by 2km, the N2K sites may actually cover more than one Natura 2000 site (Figure 5). This has been one the reasons for the removal of the Natura 2000 Site code from the N2K AoI, to avoid a misinterpretation of the data. Because within the same N2K polygon there could be reference to more than one Natura 2000 site.\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - Example of N2K AoI (red) covering multiple N2K sites (black)\n\n\nTo quantify the effects of the changing Natura 2000 Database on the N2K products a spatial analysis of the Natura 2000 database changes between 2015 and 2018 was performed.\nDuring the data preparation it became evident, that the Natura 2000 databases are more complex than expected. The Natura 2000 sites are very often defined as “multi-part” polygons (Figure 6). This means that multiple detached areas form together one Natura 2000 site. Due to the above described N2K AoI creation process, Natura 2000 sites are not always covered by the N2K product for all their single areas. This is an important fact, if N2K products are related to Standard Data Form (SDF) information, e.g. Habitat coverage within site, which relates to the complete Natura 2000 site.\nFor this all Natura 2000 sites affected by the full N2K AoI were selected from the 2015 Natura 2000 Database (version: end2015). This resulted in 3872 different site codes. Performing the same process to the 2018 Natura 2000 Database (version: end2018) led to 3868 site codes. Four site codes have changed between 2015 and 2018. Here the Natura 2000 sites had a newer release data. This was for example the case for the Danish site code DK00BX044 in 2015, which was split up into two new site codes DK00BB396 and DK00BB380 (Figure 7). The four changed site codes were also included in the spatial analysis of the 2018 data.\nOther Natura 2000 DB changes led to a partial coverage of 2018 geometries of formerly fully covered in 2015 (Figure 8). Partially these changes might still be covered by the N2K AoI, but initially the original 2km buffer around the site is no longer valid for the complete site (Figure 9).\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - Example of multi-part Natura 2000 site (AT3210001) only partially covered by N2K AOI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 - Example of changed site codes and geometries from 2015 (top) to 2018 (bottom) Natura 2000 DB version\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 - Example of Natura 2000 DB site changes from 2015 (top) to 2018 (bottom).

Background N2K AOI\n\n\nThe Natura 2000 site boundaries were intersected with the N2K AoI for both years to analyse the total area covered by the Natura 2000 sites, and their spatial overlap with the N2K AoI. Due to the fact that there are overlapping geometries in the Natura 2000 sites DB (Figure 10), the analysis was performed also with the Natura 2000 sites merged to one analysis extent.\nThe results showed that more than 98% of the area covered by the selected grassland-rich Natura 2000 sites is covered by the N2K product in for both Natura 2000 site definitions, version end2015 and end2018 (Figure 5).\n\n\n\nFigure 10 - Example of Natura 2000 DB site overlap. The site codes IT6020025, IT7120201 and IT5340010 overlay the area of site code IT7110128.\n\n\n\nTable 4 - Spatial coverage of Natura 2000 DB sites by N2K AOI in 2015 and 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2015\n2018\nDifference 2015-2018\n\n\n\n\nTotal area of Natura 2000 sites (with overlaps) [km²]\n284.195,48\n284.977,85\n+ 782,37\n\n\nTotal area of Natura 2000 sites (without overlaps) [km²]\n272.483,95\n273.266,93\n+ 782,98\n\n\nArea of Natura 2000 sites (without overlap) covered by N2K AOI [km²]\n267.820,37\n268.167,05\n+ 346,68\n\n\nPercentage of Natura 2000 area covered by N2K AOI (without overlaps) [%]\n98,3\n98,1\n- 0,2\n\n\n\nComparing the spatial dynamics of the 2015 and 2018 Natura 2000 site boundaries in comparison to the current N2K AOU showed that the selected sites in the 2018 Natura 2000 DB had around 537 km² area removed, which was still contained in the 2015 DB version, whereas around 1.320 km² were newly added in the 2018 DB version. Of this newly added area, 66% was still covered by the unchanged N2K AOI (Figure 6).\n\nTable 5 - Area changes for Natura 2000 DB sites from 2015 to 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatura 2000 area changes 2015-2018\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\nCommon area in 2015 and 2018\n\n271.946,91 km²\n\n\nArea only in 2015 data (removed)\n\n537,04 km²\n\n\nArea only in 2018 data (new)\n\n1320,02 km²\n\n\n\ncovered by N2K AOI (Inside)\n871,79 km² (66 %)\n\n\n\nnot covered by N2K AOI (Outside)\n448,23 km² (44 %)\n\n\n\nThe boundaries of Natura 2000 may change from year to year but usually those are not dramatic changes and are usually covered by the 2km buffer zone. There are however a few occasions when a change in extent may have gone over the N2K established AoI. Extreme situation illustrated below (Figure 11)\n\n\n\nFigure 11 – Example of a Natura 2000 site change in extent (enlargement): the green buffer follows the shape of the site in 2012, but in the 2018 Natura 2000 database the site has been enlarged therefore not anymore totally covered by the N2K AoI\n\n\nThis was one of the reasons why it was decided to remove the Natura 2000 site boundary from the N2K product: to allow users to use the N2K LC/LU product in combination with the Natura 2000 latest boundary, if they wish so in their dedicated assessments therefore not being bound by an outdated outline that may change on a yearly basis."

    "section": "6.2 Interpretation and Classification",
    "text": "6.2 Interpretation and Classification\nThe Interpretation and Classification procedures follow the mapping rules and principles as stated in the CLMS N2K Nomenclature and Mapping Guideline (AD01). This documentation refers specifically to object delineation; MMU and MMW; feature extraction priority rules; water level mapping rules; handling of geometric inconsistencies between the reference years; inclusion of additional data sources and the application of standardized data attributes. Feature delineation is applied at a 1:5.000 mapping scale.\nMapping LC/LU Status\nThe LC/LU status is mapped through a visual interpretation and object delineation using the above specified VHR data as primary data source. The type of LC/LU is classified according to the CLMS N2K Nomenclature and Mapping Guideline document (AD01). A minimum mapping unit (MMU) of ≥ 0.5 ha for all objects applies. A minimum width (MMW) of ≥ 10 m is defined. MMU exceptions are allowed for:\n\nObjects located at a CLMS N2K product border: If an object is cut at a border, the feature is mapped, if the whole object (inside and outside the border) would amount to ≥ 0.5 ha. However, the MMU of those divided features lying inside the site shall have a MMU of at least ≥ 0.1 ha. Smaller objects will be generalized.\nComplex changes (see changes examples below).\nLinear features (roads, railways, rivers) that are split in two or more polygons by other linear elements (e.g. the road/railway network) will be mapped even if the resulting segments are smaller than the MMU in order to preserve the network. However, features &lt; 0.1 ha will be generalized.\nUrban objects which are confined by roads or railways. Features &lt; 0.25 ha will be generalized.\n\nMMW exceptions are allowed:\n\nTo maintain continuity of features with mostly linear nature (Codes 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 8.1.1 and 8.1.2), the MMW may fall below the limit of 10 m over a distance of up to 100 m.\n\nMapping LC/LU Changes\nLand Cover Changes (LCC) are changes that occur between the different reference timespans 2006 (+/- 2 years), 2012 (+/- 2 years) and the timespan 2018 (+/- 1 year). Differences resulting from different interpretations of the same subject are not considered as change. A change is mapped if it covers over a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of &gt;0.5ha. The mapping is carried out by visual interpretation and comparison of two subsequent reference years (2006-2012, 2012-2018) and their corresponding LC/LU vector data and satellite imagery. Changed areas are directly delineated. In CLMS N2K changes are provided as separate vector products (2006-2012 and 2012-2018).\nPossible prone to change areas are, for example:\n\nConstruction sites;\nAbandoned land/grassland/cropland near urban areas;\nDamaged forest indicates that a regrowth of forest should appear;\nTransitional woodland indicates that a regrowth of forest should appear.\n\nInterpreters must be aware that not every change visible on the images should be treated as changes, e.g.:\n\ntransient phenomena such as floods and temporary water-logging;\nseasonal changes in Natural vegetation;\nseasonal changes in agriculture, such as effects of crop rotation on arable land;\nforest plantation growth, still not reaching the height and/or canopy closure of forest;\nseasonal changes of water level;\ntemporal changes in water cover of fishpond cassettes being part of their management;\nseasonal changes of snow spots in high mountains.\n\nThe introduction of false changes must also be avoided. Many of these can and should be excluded by pure logics. These vary from country to country (e.g. while normally sea water do not change into pasture, it might happen in the Netherlands), thus following examples are not exhaustive and not binding for all cases. However, in most cases they can be considered valid.\nHighly non-probable changes are for example:\n\nUrban areas to non-urban classes (1.1.1 🡺 2.-8.x.x): urban areas seldomly disappear\nConversion of a highly modified water course (e.g. canal) to a new class (8.1.2 🡺 X.X.X)\n\nBeing the most frequently occurring change type, changes &gt; 0.5 ha connected to an existing CLMS N2K polygon are always mapped. In the following example scheme an existing urban site has been enlarged by more than 0.5ha between the reference year t0 (1.1.1) and the reference year t+1.\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Simple change mapping\n\n\nAlthough the MMU for change mapping is 0.5 ha, in some cases single changes &lt; 0.5 ha are also mapped together. When a polygon, existing for the reference year t0, is split at the later t1 reference into several other areas (e.g. a road construction, urban growth, …), the individually connected change parts can be mapped together, if they make up a ≥ 0.5 ha complex change polygon. Resulting polygons in the database &lt;0.5ha receive the COMMENT attribute “Area size exception (inside Natura2000 AoI boundary)” (see chapter Technical specification and AD01).\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Complex change mapping. Individual changes with each MMU &lt; 0.5 ha make up a change area of 0.5 ha.\n\n\n“Splitted” changes can also lead to change polygons &lt;0.5ha. In the example scheme below, an existing industrial site exists in the image t0, but is not mapped in the CLMS N2K product for t0, because it is below the MMU (&lt;0.5ha). The site has enlarged between t0 and t+1 and now forms together an area &gt;0.5ha. The small industrial area from t0 “changes” now as well and forms together with the actual change a complex change area. The formerly too small area receives the COMMENT “Splitted change”.\n\n\n\nFigure 17: New established feature with splitted change.\n\n\nExceptions for a polygon &lt;0.5 ha are also allowed for unchanged areas in relation to a change situation. In the following example, an existing road in t0 is relocated. Previous road sections change to an urban class (1.1.1) and previous urban area changes to new road (1.2.1) in t+1. A small road section (&lt;0.5 ha) remains as road over the years and does not change. It gets the comment “Areas related to change” in the CLMS N2K product.\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Area related to change within road relocation."

    "text": "7.1 Internal thematic validation\nFor each CLMS N2K product a thematic validation was performed by the service providers (internal thematic validation). The assessment is based on a scientifically and statistically sound stratification and sampling scheme, tailored to assessing the thematic accuracy of the N2K LC/LU status and change layers.\nDuring the production phase of the 2018 update the following accuracies applied to these products:\n\nCLMS N2K LC/LU status map 2012 and 2018: ≥ 85 % overall accuracy and ≥ 80 % for class-specific user’s and producer’s accuracies\nCLMS N2K LC/LU change map 2012-2018: ≥ 85 % overall accuracy and ≥ 80 % for class-specific user’s and producer’s accuracies\n\nThe 2012 and 2006 products have been validated after the production phase by an independent service provider (see AD 02).\nSampling Design and Stratification\nThe thematic accuracy assessment for the CLMS N2K is based on a stratified random point sampling scheme, in which all areas have a known non-zero probability of sampling. To assess overall and class-specific accuracies, stratifications are conducted on the LC/LU code level 4 (status layer), as well as on omission and commission strata (change layer).\nResponse Design\nAll sample points were re-interpreted at Code level 4 during the validation. This step was performed as a visual interpretation by independent, well-trained operators, who were not involved in the production itself, using the applicable Very High-Resolution (VHR) satellite data defined in the production. When re-interpreting the LC/LU sample points, the response design had to respect the latest product specifications and N2K nomenclature guidelines.\nValidation results\nTo keep full statistical rigor and representativeness, and account for unequal inclusion probabilities and the relative occurrence of classes, area related weights were applied according to the area ratio for each class compared to the overall area. To deal with very imbalanced and skewed ratios between changed and unchanged areas at class level 1, an area restriction was implemented to reduce the area weight of polygons &gt; 100ha.\nThe results of the internal validation proved the sufficient thematic quality of CLMS N2K products, as can be seen in the following tables.\nFull details on the class specific user and producer accuracy results can be found in the ANNEX of this document.\n\nTable 11: LC/LU internal 1accuracy assessment - unweighted results per product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThematic accuracy [%]\nConfidence* Interval\nNo. of assessed sample points\n\n\n\n\nLC/LU 2012 overall unweighted accuracy\n96.52 %\n0.20 %\n30 203\n\n\nLC/LU 2018 overall unweighted accuracy\n96.22 %\n0.21 %\n30 203\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLC/LU change 2012-2018 overall unweighted accuracy for level 4\n97.85 %\n0.16 %\n29 088\n\n\nLC/LU change 2012-2018 overall unweighted accuracy for level 1\n98.61 %\n0.13 %\n29 088\n\n\n\n\n*at a 95% confidence level\n\n\nTable 12: LC/LU internal2 accuracy assessment - weighted results per product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThematic accuracy [%]\nConfidence* Interval\nNo. of assessed sample points\n\n\n\n\nLC/LU 2012 overall weighted accuracy\n96.80 %\n0.21 %\n30 203\n\n\nLC/LU 2018 overall weighted accuracy\n96.67 %\n0.21 %\n30 203\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLC/LU change 2012-2018 overall weighted accuracy for level 4\n98.64 %\n0.12 %\n29 088\n\n\nLC/LU change 2012-2018 overall weighted accuracy for level 1\n99.33 %\n0.08 %\n29 088\n\n\n\n\n*at a 95% confidence level\n\n\nTable 13: Unweighted User’s and Producer’s Accuracies for the Change Layer 2012 – 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser’s Accuracy\nProducer’s Accuracy\n\n\n\n\nCode Level 1\nNon-Change\nCI [%]\nChange\nCI [%]\nNon-Change\nCI [%]\nChange\nCI [%]\n\n\nClass 1\n99.56\n0.21\n95.47\n1.29\n98.78\n0.34\n98.34\n0.80\n\n\nClass 2\n99.66\n0.20\n96.57\n1.10\n98.89\n0.35\n98.93\n0.63\n\n\nClass 3\n99.95\n0.06\n94.95\n1.33\n98.82\n0.31\n99.80\n0.28\n\n\nClass 4\n100.00\n0.00\n92.94\n1.37\n94.56\n1.00\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 5\n100.00\n0.00\n96.30\n1.20\n97.83\n0.69\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 6\n99.41\n0.32\n95.11\n1.50\n98.24\n0.53\n98.31\n0.90\n\n\nClass 7\n100.00\n0.00\n93.76\n2.28\n98.12\n0.67\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 8\n99.68\n0.18\n96.64\n1.53\n99.53\n0.21\n97.73\n1.25\n\n\n\n\nTable 14: Area-weighted User’s and Producer’s Accuracies for the Change Layer 2012 – 2018 with area-restriction applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser’s Accuracy\nProducer’s Accuracy\n\n\n\n\nCode Level 1\nNon-Change\nCI [%]\nChange\nCI [%]\nNon-Change\nCI [%]\nChange\nCI [%]\n\n\nClass 1\n99.56\n0.21\n95.47\n1.29\n99.72\n0.08\n93.07\n3.15\n\n\nClass 2\n99.66\n0.20\n96.57\n1.10\n99.63\n0.12\n96.82\n1.82\n\n\nClass 3\n99.95\n0.06\n94.95\n1.33\n99.31\n0.18\n99.65\n0.48\n\n\nClass 4\n100.00\n0.00\n92.94\n1.37\n98.18\n0.35\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 5\n100.00\n0.00\n96.30\n1.20\n99.78\n0.07\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 6\n99.41\n0.32\n95.11\n1.50\n99.61\n0.12\n92.72\n3.66\n\n\nClass 7\n100.00\n0.00\n93.76\n2.28\n99.68\n0.12\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 8\n99.68\n0.18\n96.64\n1.53\n99.91\n0.04\n89.19\n5.45\n\n\n\n\nTable 15: Area-weighted User’s and Producer’s Accuracies for the Change Layer 2012 – 2018 without area-restriction applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser’s Accuracy\nProducer’s Accuracy\n\n\n\n\nCode Level 1\nNon-Change\nCI [%]\nChange\nCI [%]\nNon-Change\nCI [%]\nChange\nCI [%]\n\n\nClass 1\n99.56\n0.21\n95.47\n1.29\n99.95\n0.01\n80.47\n10.18\n\n\nClass 2\n99.66\n0.20\n96.57\n1.10\n99.98\n0.01\n62.30\n13.86\n\n\nClass 3\n99.95\n0.06\n94.95\n1.33\n99.93\n0.02\n96.70\n4.43\n\n\nClass 4\n100.00\n0.00\n92.94\n1.37\n99.94\n0.01\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 5\n100.00\n0.00\n96.30\n1.20\n99.95\n0.02\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 6\n99.41\n0.32\n95.11\n1.50\n99.93\n0.02\n78.89\n11.62\n\n\nClass 7\n100.00\n0.00\n93.76\n2.28\n99.97\n0.01\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 8\n99.68\n0.18\n96.64\n1.53\n99.99\n0.01\n53.48\n14.06"

The urban form and built-up density can be used as an indicator of building energy use. Increased density in urban areas can result in signifcant energy savings due to less energy demand for heating and cooling (Burak Güneralp, 2017). Building more compact cities has also been identified by the IPCC as an important mitigation measure for climate change, as it is related to reduced energy use per capita, primarily because of a decrease in energy used for transportation when inhabitants are able to walk or cycle to a larger extent, but also due to reduced energy use for heating and/or cooling (Burak Güneralp, 2017) (Eirik Resch, 2016) (Jiayu Li, 2022).\nThere is a relation between built-up density, building height and building energy use, and subsequently CO2-emissions due to for example heating, cooling, ventilation, and artificial lighting. Taller buildings with compact urban form suffer less heat loss than lower buildings in colder climates and high-rise buildings in warmer climates decrease the solar exposure on surrounding buildings, in suitably dense built-up areas, which may reduce the cost of cooling.

    "text": "4.3 Use case: Informing urban planning and risks to human wellbeing\nUrbanisation and dense urban living could impact spreading of infectious diseases (Wu, 2017), building height could prove an indicator of this risk to human wellbeing, supporting plans and policies to mitigate such hazards.\nThe urban form influences the urban environment and socioeconomic activities which in turn have various effects on the urban environment in terms of for example changing land cover and urban functions and structures, which can impact for example human wellbeing. The urban form can also affect urban heat islands (UHI), greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, urban ecosystems, and public health. (Yu, et al., 2022) (Tian, 2019)\nBuilding height information in cities influence metrics such as the arise of UHI, and pedestrian ventilation and pollution dispersion. Knowledge about the building height and 3D-model of cities could prove a powerful tool to inform urban planning efforts aiming to improve human wellbeing, as well as inform studies on population distribution and CO2-emissions. (Yu, et al., 2022)\nIndoor environment can also be impacted by surrounding building height, causing acoustic and illumination effects that impact the health of building occupants, thus building height (and density) information can aid in neighborhood and building design to alleviate health problems caused by acoustic or visual discomfort. (Isabelle Y.S. Chan, 2018)\nBuilding height has been shown to affect Land Surface Temperature (LST) and air temperature (Tair) and varying building heights can contribute to better ventilation and pollution dispersion in densely built areas in cities (Bálint Papp, 2021) (Zander S. Venter, 2020). Both are indicators of urban heat and can indicate the cooling requirements of urban infrastructure, and thus the energy-use and carbon emissions (Zander S. Venter, 2020), as presented in section 4.1.\nLST is important for quantifying urban heat islands (UHI) (Zander S. Venter, 2020), and has been shown having a lower correlation (than building cover and vegetation cover and height) contributing to a higher LST in relatively low buildings (up to 9 m) and cooler climates (Alexander, 2021), but having a stronger correlation (than building density and vegetation coverage) and contributing to a lower LST in high rise buildings and warmer climates (Zhong Zheng, 2019).\nTair is largely influenced by urbanisation (Zander S. Venter, 2020) and LST (Alexander, 2021), and can be predicted with building height. Both LST and Tair can be used as an indicator for human heat exposure and UHI, but Tair may be the better indicator for this specific use and can additionally be used as a determinant of urban cooling, (Zander S. Venter, 2020). This information can be used to establish policy instruments and/or national plans to prepare for and adapt to extreme heat waves and the health risks and impact this may have on the urban population. The information on building height and the relation to Tair can also be used for climate change adaptation measures in cities, to quantify the value of eco-systems services and inform nature-based solutions.\nAir temperature, Tair, is linearly connected with varying building height, and building height is one variable to predict Tair, and can significantly reduce city ventilation and thus can indirectly affect pollution dispersion (Zander S. Venter, 2020), (Bálint Papp, 2021). High-rise buildings tend to decrease natural ventilation (Burak Güneralp, 2017). Building height can also be used as an indicator of populations density and quantification of emissions (D. Ehrlich, 2018). The temperature of block surfaces, affected by building heights and density mainly when these factors combined contribute to a decreased solar radiation reaching the block surface, also affect the temperature experienced by pedestrians, wind patterns and heat loss (Yunhao Chen, 2020).\nThese indicators and information indicate the importance of open-source building height modelling for input into urban planning for human health and wellbeing and to facilitate nature-based solutions to climate change adaptation."

The measured impact of fast-onset hazards on the built environment is largely depending on the built-up area as the main indicator of impact is measured in casualties (D. Ehrlich, 2018). The more precise the measurement of disaster impact is, the better the estimations of aid and emergency services can be.\nEmergency response to man-made, meterorological or geophysical hazards leading to unfolding disasters or humanitarian emergencies could also largely benefit from population density data. The information can aid in assessment of damage severity and number of people affected, for example with the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (Copernicus EMS) or similar services. Assessment of damage can also provide useful and updated information to resource allocation, specific and exposed assets or population groups such as transport networks and route design, utilities and industry as well as settlements.

More precise data on building density is also essential for an improved modeling and assessment of population distribution, air pollution and emissions, carbon footprint, energy demand, and traffic patterns (Thomas Esch, 2022)."

Using population density and travel-to-work flows as key information, a FUA consists of a densely inhabited city and a surrounding area (commuting zone) whose labour market is highly integrated with the city (OECD 2012). For the detailed definition of urban centres, cities and FUAs please refer to “The EU-OECD definition of a functional urban area” (Dijkstra, 2019).\nThe UA BBHM product is a set of layers in GeoTIFF raster format containing building height information for 870 European cities and urban centres, located in Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) accross the EEA38 area, covering an approximate area of around 75 000 km2.\nThe UA BBHM is based on VHR imagery for the defined areas of intereste (AoI) from the reference year 2012, or as close as possible to this year, see chapter 6.2.1 for details. From these a Digital Surface Model (DSM), a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital Height Model (DHM) are created, with which the BBHM product can finally be derived.\nThe UA BBHM product has a MMU of 10 x 10 m and is projected to the European reference system EPSG:3035. All information that does not correspond to a building height value is classified as NoData, with a value in the data matrix of 65535."

These updated FUAs have been labelled “L”+number to indicate which version of FUA delineation was used (e.g. L1, L2, etc.). In the previous release of the UA BBHM this labelling was kept, but for this new UA BBHM release it has been removed. Thus, for a user who has downloaded UA BBHM files for any of the capital cities from the previous release, the files are named as for the example of Vienna (WIEN) in Figure 5‑2. As can be seen from the example, this was the second FUA version of Vienna, indicated by the “L2”. For this new release the downloaded folder names will not have this LX, where X indicates a number, see Figure 5‑3.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑2 Example of naming of previous releases’ .zip-file\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑3 Example of naming of current releases\n\n\nRegarding versioning there are a few aspects to take into consideration:\nIn the first release there were two versions: version “v010” (original version) and version “v020” if the city had been re-mapped due to some area extension, see Figure 5‑4. There were six cities with version “v020”. In this new release these cities will display version “v030”.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑4 Example of cities with areas extension, and the subsequent version ”v020”\n\n\nThe remaining 25 capital cities that were a part of the previous release have not been updated for building height values but were subjected to a remapping of “0” values into “NoData”, to be aligned with this new release. In this case these cities will display version “v020”.\nAll newly added cities for this release will display version “v010”.\n\n\n5.2.2 Dataset\nIn this folder, a raster file in GeoTIFF format is stored. This is a layer that shows the heights of the buildings, with a data type of 16-bit unsigned integer (UInt16) with LZW compression, since a negative height value on buildings is not expected. It presents a MMU of 10 x 10 meters, and it is projected to the European terrestrial reference system “ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA)” with EPSG:3035. All information that does not correspond to a building height value is classified as NoData, with a value in the data matrix of 65535. These characteristics allow the GeoTIFF file to occupy a very small size (as compared to the first release that also included “0” values). It was decided to remove the zeros because we could not distinguish a “0” that was a measured value or a “0” that referred to vegetation, water or roads (masked out).\nWhen the user opens the GeoTIFF file in a GIS software, it will be displayed using a default grayscale ramp, as the product does not have a default color ramp or style defined.\n\n\n5.2.3 Metadata\nA metadata file is created for each BBHM file, containing the information of the product. The information refers to data identification, classification of spatial data, geographic reference, temporal reference, quality and validity, conformity, constraints related to access and use and responsible organisation. These files were created according to the EEA metadata INSPIRE compliant requirements guideline.\n\n\n5.2.4 Pixel Based Information\nThe Pixel Based information data includes an ESRI shapefile layer, together with its associated files, showing the information and spatial distribution of the VHR satellite, or LiDAR, image pairs used for the construction of the Digital Height Model (DHM).\nEach file details the images conforming each false stereo pair. The information is subdivided into polygonal entities. When one of the polygonal entities is selected the accompanying attribute table can be shown, see example in Figure 5‑5. The attribute table shows the properties of the images that compose the image pair used to evaluate the building height in that specific area; like the image ID, the date of image acquisition, sensor used (vehicle, see Table 5‑2), percentage of cloud cover, the value of nadir angle, sun elevation, and value of azimuthal angle. These values are essential for the calculation of the DSM using optical satellite photogrammetry technology, see chapter 6.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑5 Shapefile attribute table with the main characteristics of sensor images used\n\n\nThe previous example is true for any of the 845 new cities added or capital cities remapped in this release, i.e. the 25 capital cities which were not remapped from the previous release will not have a folder called Pixel Based Info in the downloaded .zip-file. These 25 capital cities from the previous release have been included without remapping, however they have undergone a reprocessing as described in chapter 6.6.\nTable 5‑2 shows the name and description of the different sensors used.\n\nTable 5‑2 List of sensors used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensor\nDescription\nResolution\nSpectral Bands\n\n\n\n\nWV-01\nWorldview 1\n0.5\nPAN\n\n\nWV-02\nWorldview 2\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nWV-03\nWorldview 3\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nGE-01\nGeoEye 01\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nQB-02\nQuickbird 02\n0.65\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nIK\nIkonos\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 QC\nThe QC report is a report in PDF format with the results obtained after the execution of the quality control. This report is produced for each of the processed cities.\nThe first part of the report presents a summary table identifying the city and the name of the layer to which the report refers, the country to which it belongs, and the area assessed, as well as the organization that performs the functions of data provider and quality control, followed by a rating of the quality level, see Figure 5‑6.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑6 First part of the QC Report with a summary that has been extracted\n\n\nThis is followed by format consistency table, see Figure 5‑7, in which the conformity of the GeoTIFF file with the properties and technical characteristics relevant to data type, coordinate system, MMU etc., are evaluated.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑7 Format consistency evaluation of the dataset\n\n\nFinally, the methodology followed during the QC process is described, accompanied by an accuracy assessment table with the results obtained for each control point.

    "section": "6.1 Defining and refining the AoIs",
    "text": "6.1 Defining and refining the AoIs\nThe AoI (Area of Interest) for the BBHM represents the urban areas of each city or urban centre. It is the combination of Urban Audit cities from 20181 and urban centres from 20112 (also called high-density clusters) available at GISCO3 servers.\nThe two files were merged and added to the high-density clusters of West Balkans and Turkey delineated in the framework of a previous project since West Balkans and Turkey are not part of GISCO. It represents approximately an area of 198.000km². For simplicity reasons it was decided to call it the City Perimeter described in more detail in 6.1.1.\nThis initial AoI had to be refined. The process of refining the initial AoI is described below and illustrated in Figure 6‑2.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑2 Flowchart of the AoI refinement process\n\n\n\n6.1.1 City Perimeter (City + High density clusters polygon)\nThe City Perimeter is the outer delineation of the merging of the Urban Audit cities for 2018 and “high-density clusters” (also called “urban centres”) for 2011.\nAll these files originate from different dates but were the best available at the time. The Urban Audit cities are from 2018, the High Density Custers from 2011, while the UA underlying LC/LU data is from 2012 and the satellite information are based on 2012 data, or as close as possible to 2012, see further in chapter 6.2.1.\nThis AoI was used during the searching of satellite images for the DSMs generation.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑3 Left: City administrative area (purple) and high density cluster (black line inside purple field) of Leuven. Right: City administrative area and high-density cluster merged into City Perimeter layer\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 UA Urban Areas Classes\nThe second step in refining the AoI for the BBHM product is to select the relevant LC/LU classes from Urban Atlas where buildings are expected to be found, i.e., any classes belonging to codes 1XXXX, but not for example forests or pastures or any of the classes with codes 2XXXX-5XXXX. For reference, the nomenclature of Urban Atlas LC/LU product can be found in pages 19-21 of the Nomenclature guideline4.\nThe selected classes from the Urban Atlas representing urban areas can be seen below:\n\nAirports\nDiscontinuous dense urban fabric (S.L.: 50% - 80%)\nDiscontinuous low density urban fabric (S.L.: 10% - 30%)\nDiscontinuous medium density urban fabric (S.L.: 30% - 50%)\nDiscontinuous very low density urban fabric (S.L.: &lt; 10%)\nContinuous urban fabric (S.L.: &gt; 80%)\nIsolated structures\nIndustrial, commercial, public, military and private units\nPort areas\nGreen urban areas\nRailways\nSports and leisure facilities\n\nThis AoI (UA Urban Areas Classes) is used to clip the City Perimeter AoI, to represents areas where buildings are expected within the defined City Perimeter AoI.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑4 Comparison between City Perimeter (purple) and UA Urban Areas Classes layer (red)\n\n\nA buffer of 50 m is added around the borders to avoid border errors, see Figure 6‑5.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑5 Selected UA Urban Areas classes, city of Leuven (Belgium). Left: Final result of selected classes. Right: Example of a buffer area applied to expand the original margin.\n\n\nThe result is the UA Urban Areas classes + 50 m mapped within the City Perimeter boundaries. The polygons within this shapefile are then checked for small gaps, which are filled.\nWhenever UA LC/LU classes were missing within the City Perimeter of a selected city, these missing polygons were manually created and added. In some cases, the same UA Urban Areas classes were included in two separate cities. Depending on factors like distance between the cities, FUA codes and city codes in UA, these cities have either been considered one and the same (when close together for example) or separate cities (for example when there is a big distance between them, or the cities have different city codes in the UA).\nThe previous release of the BBHM included 38 European capital cities. These areas have not been remapped in this release, except for in cases where new areas have been added to the city’s FUA (a total of 13).\nThe total number of cities mapped in this release of the BBHM is 845.\n\n\n6.1.3 UA roads, water, and wetland\nAn additional shapefile extracted from UA is created including the UA classes of: Other roads and associated land, Water or Wetlands, see Figure 6‑6. This layer is useful to eliminate pixels that do not represent buildings.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑6 Urban roads, city of Leuven (Belgium). Left: Land uses (orange), UA Urban Areas Classes. Right: Example of class selection. (red).\n\n\nThe following example shows the different AoIs applied for the city of Münster, located in the west of Germany. Figure 6‑6 shows the three types of AoIs used in the refinement process Anything in the City Perimeter AoI which does not correspond to buildings is shown in red (will be given the value NoData in the final dataset); the UA Urban Areas Classes AoI are shown in orange (numerical values in dataset if building is present), and the UA roads, water, and wetland AoI is shown in pink.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑7 Examples of the AoIs for Münster, Germany. NoData (red), UA Urban Areas Classes (orange) and Urban Road (pink)\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Building Footprints\nBuilding Footprints represent the individual constructions that were present in 2012 within the Urban Atlas. The Building Footprints layer is obtained by applying an elaborated Python algorithm to the selected high resolution satellite images, which leverages a semantic segmentation model to extract and separate individual buildings in densely compacted areas. The algorithm considers the pixel information of the multispectral and panchromatic images.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture is used for semantic segmentation of building footprints from multispectral images, and to label every pixel in the images. After each convolution layer an extra batch normalization layer will be added to avoid any extreme values, reducing sensitivity towards initial weights and reduce overfitting of the model.\nBasic morphological operation on binary data will be used for noise removal. Thereafter a Local Maxima approach will be used to separate connected buildings, by allocating local maxima and higher weight to the larger area out of building and connection. The Local Maxima is used as input source/sink in a watershed algorithm used for image segmentation. Each building obtained from this process is given a unique index for further processing. The result is a raster.\nFor areas with dense vegetation, the algorithm might generate some confusing pixels. Therefore, a review of the Building Footprints layer has been carried out for areas with dense vegetation. Hereafter a quality control is conducted to verify that no buildings or constructions were excluded, and to discard false positives.\nThe raster is then vectorized. Spatial references and coordinate systems are preserved at every step and are transferred to vector file for correct overlaying. While converting from raster to vector, the output has a lot of vertices and noises. The vector is then simplified using Douglas-Peucker algorithm (David Douglas, 1973) to help preserve the overall geometry of the shape while simplifying number of vertices. Basic attributes like area, perimeter and elevation of the buildings were automatically added. Finally, minimum bounding box was used and saved.\nThe resulting Building Footprints was later used in the BBHM production as a mask to separate areas with height data values from areas with no height data values, see chapter 6.6. If there is building footprints data available in the area, this will be considered for refining the AoI of each city.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑8 Building footprints for the city of Leuven (Belgium)"

    "section": "6.2 Data pre-processing",
    "text": "6.2 Data pre-processing\nThe main input data is comprised of VHR satellite images from 2012, on which the different algorithms for producing the DSM and DTM will be executed, see chapter 6.3 and 6.4. The different sensors used for the VHR image collection are, as shown in Table 5‑2, Worldview 1, 2, 3, Quickbird, Ikonos and Geoeye. The aim is to acquire stereoscopic pair images, overlapping imagery acquired from different locations, to produce a 3D model for the refined AoIs.\nThe worldwide coverage of stereoscopic pair images is very limited, as it is not the most common and easy data to capture. Satellite data might therefore, despite the vast number of images, not be sufficient to create stereo pair images of all the refined AoIs in the mapped FUAs. Instead, false stereo pair images can be used. False stereo pair images make use of two images taken from different angles, and/or not on the same date or in a simultaneous capture. The images that form the false stereo pair should however be taken as close as possible to each other in time to improve the correlation between them, which increases precision. This approach guarantees coverage of all the refined AoIs with images from different dates. To create false stereo pairs the VHR satellite images from MAXAR products are supported with Copernicus satellite images through Copernicus Reference Access Data (CORDA), and as a further option LiDAR information.\nIn cases where no satellite image close to year 2012 is available, and also no images from CORDA, the search date range is expanded, primarily around 2012 (Q4 for 2011 or Q1 for 2013) and secondarily for later years (2014 onwards) as later years have more available satellites (WV3 etc.) from which data imagery can be gathered.\nThe process of selecting suitable VHR, CORDA and LiDAR imagery was based on the following key factors:\n\nImagery availability from the MAXAR Catalogue, CORDA\nDate of capture, see detailed description in chapter 6.2.1\nOff-Nadir Angle and Cloud Cover, see detailed description in chapter 6.2.2\n\n\n6.2.1 Date of capture\nThe following are the relevant scenarios for fulfilling the “Date of capture”-criteria for the selection of VHR and LiDAR images:\n\nScenario 1: The best option for selection of images is the use of LiDAR information from dates as close as possible to 2012, when available. This scenario shows better results since there is more density and precision.\nScenario 2: The second best option is images from 2012 taken in the same month and in the same day. Part of the area has been reviewed and is covered with images from 2012. Where images are not available, LiDAR information from 2012, or on a date as close as possible to 2012, will be prioritized for generating the BBHM.\nScenario 3: The third best option is to use images from 2012 captured in the same month but on different days.\nScenario 4: The fourth best option is using images from second half of 2011 or first half of 2013 in the same month and in the same day.\nScenario 5: The fifth best option is images from 2012 with a difference in date of capture of approximately 1 month.\nScenario 6: Scenario 2 but in the first part of 2011 or in the second part of 2013\nScenario 7 (extra): Images from 2014, 2015 and 2016… until today of similar dates (i.e. captured on the same day or week). It has been shown that images of the same season and similar date give good results for obtaining elevation models even though the dates differ by one year. The only thing that would affect this scenario is in terms of large changes in apples that were not in one of the years being analyzed. In this scenario, an analysis of change between the two dates will be made. Thanks to the refinement of the AoI the commission and omission error will be minimized because the Refined AoI is focused on the Urban Areas.\n\nThe images are selected and downloaded from the MAXAR library and organized in pairs of images for each city. The images are separated by CAT IDs, which is a unique code for each image. Images were then quality controlled for errors, reviewed and validated for use, as well as merged to ease the further processing of the images. This phase generates as a result a list of selected images to be used in the next analysis, where the algorithms for creating the DSM and DTM are applied.\n\n\n6.2.2 Off-Nadir Angle and Cloud Cover\nThe most suitable satellite images were selected, in the case of Off-Nadir angle, based on base-to-height ratio, Convergence, BIE and Asymmetry Angle. If these values, when estimated, are not in the correct range, the DSMs are not correctly built.\n\n6.2.2.1 Off-Nadir Angle\nThe best is to have images with an Off-Nadir angle of 20 degrees. Pairs formed with images that have less than 5 degrees or more than 45 degrees Off-Nadir angle give bad results, and are discarded. As far as possible, images with Off-Nadir angles of more than 40 degrees have been avoided. From these criteria two scenarios are made:\n\nScenario 1: Pair of satellite images with Off-Nadir angles of between 10 and 20 degrees\nScenario 2: Satellite images with Off-Nadir angles of between 5 and 30 degrees, preferably between 5 and 20 degrees\n\nFor urban areas, large angles of convergence would lead to ground occlusions, as well as a loss of similarity between the two images that form the “stereo pair” and, consequently, a worsening of the process of searching for homologous points by automatic correlation (matching). For these reasons, small Base/Height (B/H) ratios are preferred in urban areas (Eckert and Hollands, 2010). Using an algorithm that considers the maximum and minimum incidence angle, the time difference of the images, the angle between the two images and the region of interest, a Pearson’s correlation matrix and a B/H coefficient as a function of the orbital geometric parameters of the image, as well as temporal parameters are obtained, thanks to which it is possible to find which “false stereo pair” image is the most suitable to use in the generation of the DSM, see chapter 6.3.\n\nThe selected false stereo pair images have an angle difference of 20 degrees and none of them beyond 35 degrees.\n\n\n6.2.2.2 Cloud cover\nThe aim is to generate cloud-free results, for this reason all scenes were selected, regardless of cloud cover. This approach maximized the results, facilitating the selection of the best scenarios. In case some scattered cloudiness was found in an image, a proprietary cloud masking algorithm based on multilayer neural networks was applied. If clouds covered buildings in an image, this image was discarded. In case some scattered cloudiness could be found, a proprietary cloud masking algorithm based on multilayer neural networks was applied."

    "text": "6.3 Generating the DSM\nBased on the (false) stereo pair images, a digital surface model (DSM) is generated, which represents the height of all objects above the earth’s surface, i.e. plant/forest canopy or the top of artificial constructions such as buildings.\nThe major steps in creating the DSM are:\n\nSelection of suitable (false) stereo pair images\nPixel-wise stereo correspondence\nVoid filling\nAutomated outlier detection and removal\n3D point cloud creation, including RPC improvement\nProjection, alignment and homogenisation of the 3D point cloud\nProcess QA\n\nThe avaiable false stereo pair images for a certain AoI, obtained through the process described in chapter 6.2, are further processed to generate the DSM. The method for generating the DSM is based on taking elevations from the terrain using the false stereo pair satellite images, and by choosing the most suitable false stereo pair images. The images chosen are panchromatic with high spatial resolution of 30, 40 or 50 cm, and RPC information.\nThereafter a stereo correspondence between the two chosen images that make up each false stereo image pair is conducted, using a patented-modified version of the Semi-Global Matching (SGM) algorithm. The algorithm is based on global energy minimization that comprises a cost of equalization in pixels and smoothness terms in disparity mapping. The algorithm then applies a 3-kernel median filter to fill in small holes in null match points in the disparity map. By implementing a version of the classic RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) based on reverse methodology, outliers are eliminated.\nLastly, a 3D point cloud is obtained by triangulating the stereo correspondences between the two panchromatic VHR images, taking into consideration the rational polynomial coefficients (RPC) camera model provided for each image. The RCPs will allow triangulating the position of a 3D point identified on an image pair. This elaboration of the Digital Surface Models (DSM) is carried out using an AI-EOSURFACE algorithm on Python and C++ (and compatible with C heads) based on the epipolar geometry of a given pair of satellite images, see Figure 6‑9.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑9 Schematic representation of the epipolar geometry for a given pair of satellite images, on which the AI-EOSURFACE algorithm is based to obtain elevations\n\n\nThis algorithm has been developed for the DSM generation based on the bidimensional couple of points of a pair for the later three-dimensional densification. The dataset includes images from different platforms, all of them with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m. The DSM generation only requires the panchromatic band, however RGB and NIR bands were included as these are required for other processes of the BBHM creation.\nThe independently calculated 3D point cloud is then projected, aligned and homogenized, and the DSM is generated with a spatial resolution of 50 cm, and all DSMs are transformed to an orthometric height because to transform height data into meters of above sea level."

Non-ground features such as buildings, trees, bushes and vehicles have to be identified, and their height measurements removed from the data before interpolation. Once the DSM has been generated, it is filtered using a building emptying algorithm and removing objects that are not bare ground. Thereafter a pixel level prediction and clustering approach is used on a high-resolution multispectral image to detect the bare terrain.\nThe DTM is carried out using an AI-EOTERRAIN algorithm on Python to process each row of the given DSM separately in all directions in a window with a given extent, considering the minimum value of each row as the position of the ground. Therefore, if the pixel being evaluated has a large difference with the minimum value, the pixel is considered as not corresponding to ground, as well as when the slope between the evaluated pixel and the next one is positive and above a predefined threshold. If the slope is positive but less than the threshold, the evaluated pixel gets the same label as the pixel evaluated in the previous iteration. If the slope is less or equal, the distance to the nearest ground point is used to decide whether the evaluated pixel is classified as ground or not.\nThe building extraction process was successful with most buildings, however, in buildings that occupy a large area, the algorithm interprets the innermost areas of the roofs as ground values, due to the homogeneity of the slopes. To ensure that all values of the emptied DSM correspond to ground values, a second filtering is done using the buildings footprints layers, see chapter 6.1.4.\nDSM algorithm | Building footprints | DSM filtered\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑10 DSM filtering to remove large buildings and obtain the DTM\n\n\nThereafter the remaining bare ground is filtered by a cut off range for objects to remain in the DTM. This is based on the gradient difference, the size of the object to be removed and the terrain type, this can be either flat or hilly. A “bump and pit”-filter is applied to smoothe the DTM by removing small pits and bumps in the landscape; a median filter which is part of the final smoothing of the DTM; and finally the clamp filter, which stabilizes portions of the elevation model by raising and lowering pixels within a defined threshold.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑11 Left: DSM for an area in London. Right: DTM for an area in London\n\n\nThe generated file retains the same properties as the DSM in terms of extension and spatial resolution."

    "text": "6.6 Generating the BBHM\nOnce the DHM of the city is available, it is necessary to extract only the height values that correspond to buildings. To do this, first all the buildings are detected from the available multispectral VHR images, using machine learning techniques. Then a building footprint extraction operation is performed, obtaining a GeoTIFF raster layer with the height values of the buildings, and with a NoData value for all those elements which are not buildings.\nTo extract the values that correspond to buildings, the vector files of the building footprints and the DHM files are required as input.\nSince the building footprints layer are in vector format with complex geometries, these are transformed into Boolean raster format, where the pixels with zero values represent the areas that do not include buildings.\nOnce the DHM file and its associated building footprints file are both available in raster format and with the same extension, a multiplication is performed, resulting in a DHM with height values only in the areas occupied by buildings. Finally, all pixels with zero in height value, i.e. the height assigned to all elements other than buildings, are reclassified to a NoData value, as otherwise they could have a negative influence on subsequent processes. This is an important difference to note between the 2006 and 2012 edition of the BBHM. It was introduced in this release since in the previous release it was not possible to distinguish between satellite measured zero values, and zero values assigned because of the type of area. Instead, in this release, all areas not representing buildings have a NoData value.\nFinally, the DHM has undergone resampling through a number of filters; reprojection to EPSG3035 coordinate system, removal of pixels outside of the City Perimeter AoI, removal of pixels outside of the UA Urban Areas AoI, removal of pixels within the Urban roads AoI and finally resampling from a resolution of 0.5m to a resolution of 10 m using a majority filter.\nThis point explains why it is necessary to translate the 0 height data values of the input DHM to NoData, since otherwise the majority of values in a pixel corresponding to a building could be equal to 0 due to the influence of the surrounding street.\nIt is also important to point out the role played by vegetation in this process, since, as the DSM is derived from stereoscopic images; it is possible that trees near buildings influence the final value of certain pixels.\nAlso, a reclassification of all pixels with a value lower than 3 m is performed, since it is assumed that no buildings are lower than 3 m.\nFinally, a final conversion of the DHM files is executed to adapt them to the requirements set according to CLMS Tools needs.\n\nEPSG:3035 coordinate reference system\nGeoTIFF data type UInt16.\nNo data value equal to 65535.\nCompression type LZW\nPixel size 10 m\nBLOCKSIZE 256x256 Specification\nTILED = YES\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑13 From a general DHM (left) to a BBHM (right) in Münster, Germany\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑14 Final BBHM at 10x10 meter resolution for Münster, Germany\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑15 General overview of building height values on Milano and zoom to the city center"

    "section": "6.7 Characteristics and limitations of the product",
    "text": "6.7 Characteristics and limitations of the product\nThis chapter describes the properties of the product and some methodological aspects that are important to understand the characteristics and limitations of the product.\nIt is important to note that because the DSMs are derived from LiDAR and VHR satellite information, the initially generated DHMs have a spatial resolution of between 0.5 and 2 meters. For the final product to comply with EEA technical requirements (spatial resolution of 10 meters), a resampling operation was performed to transform the DHM pixels from 0.5-2 m to 10 m.\nFor this transformation to be consistent with the first height values obtained, it was agreed to use a majority algorithm, i.e. the calculation will determine the most common value shown by the 0.5 - 2 m pixels contained within a new 10 m pixel, which will be assigned the most repeated value after the execution of this analysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑16 Methodological explanation about how the majority filter works when resampling\n\n\nIt is this simple resampling operation that poses the main limitations of the BBHM Urban Atlas product, which are further detailed below.\n\nNo height values in buildings that are smaller that the minimum mapping size\n\nDue to the spatial resolution of the pixel, there will be a NoData value in buildings smaller than 100 m2, such as single-family houses, buildings for public use etc., see example in Figure 6‑17.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑17 Small houses that have not been captured in the BBHM due to the minimum mapping size\n\n\n\nIssues on building edges\n\nThe influence of height values of elements or artifacts adjacent to the buildings can induce abnormally high or low values in the pixels of the edges of the buildings. In case of influence of the ground abnormally low values would be presented, or abnormally high values if it is a tree or other vertical element that interferes.\nThis happens, in addition to the majority algorithm, when extracting the height values within the building footprints. This is because it is very unusual that the outline of the building represented in the DHM coincides exactly with its building footprint, which causes the edge pixels to be retained in the DHM prior to the resampling process and, therefore, may interfere with the final result.\nThe example in Figure 6‑18 shows the height values obtained for a random building, in this case obtained by means of LIDAR technology, with a spatial resolution of 2 m.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑18 Satellite imagery (left) and DSM at half meter resolution (right)\n\n\nFigure 6‑19 shows how some pixels, with ground elevation information, are represented in red tones after extraction of the DHM values in relation to the building footprints.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑19 Difference between DSM at half meter resolution and final BBHM (right)\n\n\nWhen the resampling operation is performed and the final result is obtained, this ground elevation information is transferred to the pixels that make up the building boundary, causing the aforementioned alterations in the value of these pixels.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑20 Overview of building edges in the BBHM\n\n\nWithout a detailed case-by-case study it is not possible to conclude wheter these height deviations are caused by elements of the building itself or by influences from the ground or other artifacts. Thus, these pixels have not been corrected beyond those clearly identified during QC, which is the main limitation of the project.\nThe influence of edge elements becomes more noticeable in cities whose DHM values have been calculated from a DSM derived from VHR satellite imagery. This is because optical satellite photogrammetry technology does not reach the same levels of accuracy as achieved by LIDAR, and its results depend heavily on the acquisition properties of the images. Especially important are the angles and the correlation calculated between the two images, giving the results a more continuous and smooth appearance, i.e. there is no perfect detection of abrupt elevation changes intrinsic to the height difference between a building and the ground.\nThis behavior is especially noticeable in cities with a high density of buildings, close together, separated by narrow streets, typical in urban centers of historic cities. This combined with the resampling algorithm can result in areas with apparently great variability of building heights. This phenomenon can be observed in Figure 6‑21.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑21 Higher heterogeneity in BBHM dataset (right) than in a half meter resolution BBHM (bottom left)\n\n\n\nRoof artifacts\n\nAnother limitation of the product lies in the poor response to the LIDAR pulses of some roofs, especially noticeable in the metal cladding that covers some industrial buildings. These errors do not occur when using satellite photogrammetry and thus do not pose an issue in most of the processed cities. To correct the errors, the erroneous pixels are manually reclassified with the correct elevation value.\n\nLimitation of building footprints detection in scattered areas\n\nThe building footprints identification algorithm based on Machine Learning techniques has certain limitations when detecting isolated buildings, especially in rural environments, since the algorithm considers certain properties of coherence and spatial context for the identification of buildings. In the same way, the algorithm may present commission errors, which have been eliminated whenever they have been detected during QC.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑22 Limitations on building footprint detection especially; comission and omission\n\n\n\nUrban Areas with no values outside the AoI\n\nAs stated previously in the document, building height values are only gathered inside the AoI (see definition in chapter 6.1). In some cases, it is not possible to produce building height data for the entire delineation of the AoI, i.e. when part of the defined high-density cluster delineation falls outside the area that has been mapped by Urban Atlas. For example, the AoI for Malinas is a high-density cluster but is not mapped by Urban Atlas and does not have a FUA (no Urban Classes). Thus, it is key to consider that in these cases some urban areas in the city surroundings are not captured, so there is no height value.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑23 General view of Malinas, capturing industrial areas with no height values outside the AoI\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of DSM generation\n\nDSM generation from false pair stereo of satellite images is always challenging, since it depends on several variables: off-nadir angle, difference in days between images, cloud cover, etc. These values vary from city to city, but in general terms these have been the main issues:\n\nDSM orthorectification\nBuilding shadows\nSmall houses’ height\nOutlier removal\nWater-topography influence\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑24 Examples of the limitations of the DSM production\n\n\n\nLimitations on DTM generation\n\nWhen generating a DTM from DSM, the reliability on the accuracy of the DSM falls, e.g. a DSM derived from a high-density point cloud by using LiDAR information is more reliable than one built from satellite imagery. Also, an automatic algorithm pursues a constant accuracy across different realities, setting parameters to fix values that better capture all. However, larger buildings (e.g. industrial buildings) may not be removed completely, so a manual editing has been carried out in all the cities.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑25 Example of DTM refinement"
