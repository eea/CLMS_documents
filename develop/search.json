    "text": "4.1 Product description\n\n4.1.1 Land Use / Land Cover mapping\nThe Urban Atlas service offers a high-resolution land use map of urban areas. Initially covering over 300 European cities with more than 100,000 inhabitants for the 2006 reference year, the Urban Atlas is available for the 2012 and 2018 reference years over nearly 800 cities with more than 50,000 inhabitants distributed among EU, EFTA and West Balkan countries plus United Kingdom and Turkey. Each Urban Atlas product is generated over the city and its surroundings, according to the Functional Urban Area (FUA) defined by the implementation of the approach developed by the DG Regional and Urban Policy (REGIO) of the European Commission.\nThe product described in this mapping guide is adapted to European needs (discussed and agreed with DG REGIO) and contains information that can be derived mainly from Earth Observation (EO) data backed by other reference data, such as Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) or Open Street Map (OSM) navigation data and topographic maps.\nDetailed specifications of Urban Atlas LU/LC product.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nUrban Atlas LU/LC\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nVery high-resolution land use and land cover dataset of Functional Urban Areas\n\n\nINSPIRE themes\nLand cover\nLand use\n\n\nGeographic description\nEU, EFTA and West Balkan countries plus United Kingdom and Turkey\n\n\nTemporal description\n2006 / 2012 / 2018\n\n\nPurpose\nProvide the baseline of land use/land cover data on Functional Urban Areas extracted from VHR and other available imagery (and combined with in-situ data) to allow the study of the characteristics of these areas in comparison with major urban areas in the EU and EFTA countries.\n\n\nMinimum Mapping Unit\n0.25 ha in urban areas (level 1)\n1 ha in rural areas (level 2-5)\n\n\nMinimum mapping width\n10 m between two objects for distinct mapping\n\n\nNomenclature\nAs provided in the Chapter 4.4. table 3 (containing 27 classes)\n\n\nProjection\nETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) (EPSG 3035)\n\n\nDelivery formats\nShapefile (2006), EsriFileGDB (2012), GeoPackage (2018)\n\n\nMetadata\nINSPIRE Metadata Implementing Rules: Technical Guidelines based on EN ISO 19115 and EN ISO 19119\n\n\nPositional accuracy\nAccording to geo-location accuracy of satellite imagery delivered by ESA\n\n\nOverall classification accuracy\n≥ 85 % in urban classes (class 1)\n≥ 80 % in rural classes (classes 2 to 5)\n≥ 80 % overall accuracy\n\n\n\nThe table provided in Annex 5.3 gives a more detailed description of the product specifications.\n\n\n\nExample of the “look & feel“ of the final Urban Atlas 2012 product for Brussels\n\n\n\n\n4.1.2 Additional information layers\nThe Urban Atlas Mapping Guide is related to the main product and by default refers to the Land Use / Land Cover (LU/LC) database. However, two additional information layers are also available starting from the 2012 reference year. A short description including the detailed specifications is proposed in this section.\nThe first one is called Street Tree Layer (STL), a separate layer from the Urban Atlas LU/LC map produced within the level 1 urban mask for each FUA (partial coverage for 2012 reference year). It includes contiguous rows or patches of trees along the streets.\n\nDetailed specifications of Urban Atlas STL product\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTitle\nStreet Tree Layer\n\n\n\n\nAbstract\nVery high-resolution tree cover dataset of inside nomenclature level 1 areas.\n\n\nINSPIRE themes\nLand cover\n\n\nGeographic description\nEU, EFTA and West Balkan countries plus United Kingdom and Turkey\n\n\nTemporal description\n2012 (partial coverage) / 2018\n\n\nPurpose\nMapping of contiguous rows or patches of trees covering inside the nomenclature level 1 areas.\n\n\nMinimum Mapping Unit\n500 m²\n\n\nMinimum mapping width\n10 m\n\n\nNomenclature\nTree (STL=1) or Nodata (99)\n\n\nProjection\nETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) (EPSG 3035)\n\n\nDelivery formats\nShapefile (2012), GeoPackage (2018)\n\n\nMetadata\nINSPIRE Metadata Implementing Rules: Technical Guidelines based on EN ISO 19115 and EN ISO 19119\n\n\nPositional accuracy\nAccording to geo-location accuracy of satellite imagery delivered by ESA\n\n\nOverall classification accuracy\n≥ 80 % in urban classes\n\n\n\nThe second one is a Digital Height Model (DHM) providing building bloc height information. This consists of a 10 m x 10 m resolution raster layer containing height information generated for urban areas of selected cities (currently the core area of capitals of all countries covered by the Urban Atlas).\nThe building height information is derived from IRS-P5 stereo images of the reference year 2012. It contains only the heights of the building bloc itself (i.e. trees are masked out). As described in the terms of reference, the mean absolute error of the height must be below 3m.

    "section": "4.2 General guidelines",
    "text": "4.2 General guidelines\n\n4.2.1 Pre-processing and geo-coding of EO data\nThe EO data provided to the Service Provider should already be pre-processed. In order to reach the 1/10,000 expected scale, EO data should be provided with spatial resolution less than 5 meters. Service Provider should check the geometric quality of the delivered EO data, but no further pre-processing step is expected. The EO data for the European Urban Atlas 2012 is the optical VHR2 coverage over EU 2011-2013 (DWH_MG2b_CORE_03) available on Data Warehouse (DWH) of the European Space Agency (ESA). The EO data for the Urban Atlas 2018 is an optical VHR coverage over EU 2017-2019 also available on ESA DWH. Change detection task can be supported by Copernicus Sentinel-2 data (10 m resolution).\n\n\n4.2.2 Pre-processing and geometric adaptation of navigation data\nThe EO data are the basis for interpretation and classification. In case of geometrical differences between EO data and navigation data (COTS or OSM), the navigation data has to be corrected in line with the EO data.\nThe pre-processing and application of the navigation data (COTS or OSM) shall be done according to the methodology defined in Annex 5.2.\n\n\n4.2.3 Pre-processing of topographic maps\nTopographic maps can be used for interpretation of objects. Topographic maps should be used in digital form with precise geo-coding. The usage of printed (analogue) maps is not recommended. In case of geometrical differences between EO data and topographic maps, the erroneous data (either EO-data or topo-maps) needs to be identified using reliable datasets providing spatial reference information. The geometry of the mapping product shall then be congruent with the correct dataset.\n\n\n4.2.4 Classification and interpretation\nApplication of automatic classification routines, such as segmentation and clustering, may be applied whenever appropriate:\nAutomated segmentation and classification to achieve an initial differentiation between basic land cover classes (urban vs. forest vs. water vs. other land cover) is possible following a decision of the service providers.\nAs the backbone for the object geometry, the navigation data network (COTS or OSM) is recommended but only with the method defined in the Annex.\nManual refinement and classification at the finest level of the LU/LC classification especially within urban areas by means of visual interpretation of EO data remain necessary to be compliant with the product specifications. For this purpose, the following sections provide the rules and principles to be applied.\n\n\n4.2.5 Use of Copernicus HRL imperviousness\nAmong the reference products from Copernicus Land Monitoring Services (CLMS), the pan-European High-Resolution Layer (HRL) Imperviousness (formerly named Fast Track Sealing layer, FTS) is used for the classification at level 4 of the residential or mixed use urban fabric units classified 1.1.2 from EO data\nThe assignment of the imperviousness/soil sealing levels or density (i.e. classes 1.1.2.1 - 1.1.2.4) shall be carried out using the HRL Imperviousness layer or similar one. The Quality Assurance (QA) process will check only if the technical approach agreed with DG REGIO is respected but will not assess the absolute accuracy of these classes.\n\n\n4.2.6 Data format of the final product\nESRI ArcGIS compatible or open source OGC-standard vector format with polygon topology:\n\nComplete coverage in a single area feature layer.\nNo overlapping polygons, gaps, duplicates or missing polygon labels or node overshoots.\nFinal vectors need to have a smooth appearance (no pixel-shaped polygons are allowed). The smoothing shall be done by the service provider by methods preserving the geometry of objects. It is to ensure that smoothed vectors still comply with the minimum width and minimum mapping units required for objects.\n\n\n\n\nExample provided of the number for UA class 1.1.2.1\n\n\n\nColumn data format:\nCODE_yyyyy: 5 digits in Long Integer format without decimal places (values allowed: 11100 to 92000 (all class codes))\nThe complete description of the data format is provided in section 5.4.\n\n\n4.2.7 Interpretation rules\n\nThe delineation is to be done on the EO data. EO data should be considered as the primary (guiding) data source.\nThe interpretation of the object is done using:\n\nThe EO data, topographic maps, navigation data (COTS or OSM) and other relevant ancillary data.\nAuxiliary information including local expertise.\n\nThe interpreted area should be interpreted with a minimum 100 m extension (100 m buffer) to ensure accuracy and continuity of polygons. During the post-processing phase, a subset with the spatial extent of the final product will be generated. At the borders of this subset (i.e. the final product), polygons smaller than the MMU may be present. To be in line with this rule, please note that a 100m extension buffer has been applied over sea / ocean for the coastal FUAs for the 2012 & 2018 products.\nIn areas where two or more scenes overlap, the most recent data must be used for delineation and interpretation.\nIn case of cloud coverage over the most recent scene, the affected part (only this part!) shall be interpreted using a cloudless alternative scene.\n\n\n\nIf two or more objects are overlapping at different levels, the top level is mapped continuously, e.g. road bridge over railway is mapped as seen, the railway polygon is split in two parts and the road is mapped as a continuous feature.\nIn case of two or more objects overlapping at the same height level, the visually dominant and complete object (in use and shape) is mapped continuously. For example, a road / railway crossing viewed at the same height level: the railway shall be mapped continuously to maintain the network. The road shall be split in two parts.\nAnalysis scale : 1:5 000\n\n\n\n4.2.8 LU/LC change detection and layer generation\nIn case of the required production of an update of the Urban Atlas LU/LC database for a historic or new reference year, change detection task shall be performed and an additional layer shall be produced by the service provider, the Land Use / Land Cover (LU/LC) change layer. For the European Urban Atlas, following the LU/LC product generation for the 2006 reference year, change detection were performed successively for generating the 2012 and 2018 products.\nChange detection and characterization shall be performed considering the VHR ortho-rectified optical satellite imagery as the reference. Adopting a manual methodological approach based on the visual comparison between the images from two different reference years is always required, but it can also be combined with automatic change detection approaches (image-to-image or map-to-image) which should improve the performances. Otherwise, as the change layer shall only contain real changes between two reference years, any inconsistencies of LU/LC codes will not be considered as a change if due to thematic misclassification inherited from the LU/LC information related to the first reference year already available. In such a case, it is worth to correct LU/LC misclassifications related to this year and generate a revised status layer accordingly.\nIn the specific case of the change detection between 2012 and 2018 for the European Urban Atlas, LU/LC misclassifications from 2012 are corrected but only in the immediate surroundings of the actual LU/LC change area, which led to produce a revised LU/LC 2012 status layer. Otherwise, LU/LC changes from, to, or within urban areas are detected, extracted and characterized at the finest level of the nomenclature, in accordance with the MMUs listed below. However, LU/LC changes occurring within rural/natural areas are mapped only if the change occurs at level 1 of the nomenclature, then well characterized at the finest level (ex: change from 31000 to 23000). In other words, changes that occur within the same rural/natural areas are not mapped (for instance, changes from 21000 to 22000 are not identified and therefore not included in the change layer).\nChanges are firstly reported in an intermediate layer identified as Urban Atlas 2012-2018 LU/LC which contains the LU/LC information for both reference dates, 2012 and 2018. More concretely, based on the 2012 LU/LC information, polygon features of detected changes are delineated and characterized for 2018. Then, the change layer is generated, but it is worth to highlight that it is not performed by a fully blind extraction of all area features for which LU/LC classification codes are different. Indeed, there are one exception for which the area features are not considered for generating the change layer: isolated structures logically classified as 11300 for 2012 reference year and classified as continuous or discontinuous urban fabric unit (11100 or 11200) for 2018 only because of urban expansion over the period but without any actual LU/LC change (contextual reason). This means that for getting real changes occurred between 2012 and 2018, the 2012-2018 change layer shall be used; combining both status layers and extracting the features which have different LU/LC classifications overtime will not provide this information.\nA particular case : forest cuts.\nAs it is often quite difficult to predict the future LU/LC over an area resulting from a forest cut, the rule applied is the following:\n\nForest cuts are included in Class 31000 named ‘Forests’ by default as it is mentioned in Section 4.6, and systematically in case such areas are fully surrounded by wooded area.\nForest cuts are included in another class as soon as they occur at the edge of the forest and that the context given by VHR reference imagery justifies such a choice (e.g. pastures, orchards, future construction site, etc.).\n\n\n\n\nChange Dynamics over FR010L2 Montpellier (2012-2018)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.9 Street tree layer\nThe Street Tree Layer 2012 (STL2012) and Street Tree Layer 2018 (STL2018) are separate layers from respectively the UA2012 and UA2018 LU/LC Layers, which are produced within the level 1 urban mask for each FUA. They include contiguous rows or patches of trees covering 500m² or more and with a minimum width (MinMW) of 10 m over “Artificial surfaces” (nomenclature class 1) inside FUA (i.e. rows of trees along the road network outside urban areas or forest adjacent to urban areas should not be included).\nThe following specific rules have to be applied:\n\nException to the 10 m MinMW rule: in order to maintain continuity, units smaller than 10 m over a distance up to 10 m can still be included in STL (see figures below).\n\n\n\n\nBorder effect correction: road network crossing wooded area and connecting cities and villages is fully classified as STL due to tree crown cover by default. Therefore, post-processing step needs to be implemented for correcting this misclassification.\n\n\n\nAn urban mask analysis to exclude road and railway networks connecting cities and villages shall be applied to solve this border effect. Urban Mask analysis needs to define a tolerance fixed to 50 m that well differentiate urban and interurban networks. Large railway infrastructures may be excluded from the mask, but this is not an issue knowing that trees are very rare in such areas.\n\nSTL patches do not cover roads (codes 12210 and 12220) or railways (code 12230) connecting cities, that are outside the urban mask.\n\nMMU rule (&gt;500 m²) is applied to STL polygons (STL = 1)\nThe STL layer contains trees (STL = 1) or No data (STL= 99).\n\n\n\n\nComparison between VHR2018 scene (left) and STL2018 product (right)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.10 Digital Height Model layer (DHM)\nA 10 m raster layer containing height information is generated for core urban areas of capital cities of the EEA38 and the United Kingdom as part of the Urban Atlas project (see table 2), based on the methodology described hereafter.\n\nBase data\n\n\nThe input data source of stereo data is the IRS-P5 Cartosat-1. In May 2005, the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) had launched the IRS-P5 Cartosat-1 satellite, equipped with the PAN-Aft and PAN-Fore instruments that form a dual-optics 2-line (forward and backward looking) along-track stereoscopic push broom scanner with a stereo angle of 31°, an original spatial resolution of 2.5 m and a swath width of 27 km. The satellite covers the entire globe in 1867 orbits on a 126-day cycle.\nBecause of its optimized stereo configuration (stereo acquisitions within seconds and optimized acquisition angles), IRS-P5 Cartosat-1 high-resolution stereo satellite imagery has proven to be perfectly suited for the creation of the digital surface models in the resolution and quality requested.\nThe very comprehensive data situation and the unique specifications guarantee a very good coverage of urban areas in Europe by one single data source.\n\nDSM generation\n\n\nBased on the stereo images, a digital surface model (DSM) is generated, which represents the height of all objects above the earth’s surface, i.e. plant/ forest canopy or the top of artificial constructions such as buildings.\nThe major steps are:\n\nSelection of suitable stereo images\nPixel-wise matching approach\nBundle block adjustment and RPC improvement\nAutomated outlier detection\nVoid filling\nProcess QA\n\nThe result of the DSM processing chain is an accurate and reliable 3 m DSM (to get the full advantages of the higher resolution, e.g. for a better delineation of buildings), which will be further regularised to the final 10 m resolution in the nDSM generation step, to fit the product requirements.\n\nDTM generation\n\n\nDigital terrain models (DTMs) represent the height of the bare earth’s surface. In this case, the DTMs are generated from a DSM and non-ground features such as buildings, trees, bushes and vehicles have to be identified and their height measurements be removed from the data before interpolation.\nIn order to ensure meeting the DTM quality requirements even in complicated terrain situations and to ensure best possible accuracy of generated DTMs, it is useful to combine the extracted ground point results of different filter methods or apply regionally adjusted algorithm parameterizations.\nThe interpolation approach carried out in this project is ordinary Kriging. It is the most commonly used Kriging method, used in simulations for spatial data, commonly considered to best minimizes the variance of the estimation error.\n\nnDSM generation and refinement\n\n\nThe next step towards finally retrieving building block heights is the creation of a normalized Digital Surface Model (nDSM). An nDSM is the difference between a DTM and a DSM used to show height values of buildings, vegetation and other objects.\nnDSM = DSM – DTM\n\n\n\nDSM computation principle (http://www.stadtentwicklung.berlin.de/umwelt/umweltatlas/ed610_03.htm)\n\n\nAs there are vegetation and other untilled areas included in the raw nDSM, hence a substantial further quality refinement with different ancillary datasets is necessary to generate a sharp and error-free digital building block height model.\nAncillary datasets consist of (i) built-up area, water and street classes of Urban Atlas 2012 and (ii) NDVI map for vegetation removal, calculated from Spot 5 seamless mosaics.\nThe nDSM at this stage is a 3 m resolution intermediate product that is then resampled with a maximum upscaling process to the final 10 m horizontal resolution, and which is then finally sharpened by using the borders of the built-up area classes from Urban Atlas 2012. Values outside these classes are set to Zero. Each pixel represents a height value and no statistics have been calculated based on the building block heights.\nIn a last refinement step the accuracy specifications are checked and if necessary, heights are adapted.\n\n\n\nCoverage of Vienna core area with relevant UA 2012 built-up classes\n\n\n\nPost processing and product finalization\n\n\nIn the final post-processing and product package generation step, the properly refined nDSM with building block heights, which are considered the final product (Digital Height Models – DHM) are checked by an automated routine for adherence to the following basic technical and formal product specifications:\n\n10 m spatial resolution.\nETRS89 – Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection.\nConsistent file format, naming and structure, class legends and color codes.\nCorrect height values / background values.\n\nEach Building Block Height model (DHM) is clipped exactly to the AOI and assigned a folder with a corresponding name. As a further automated step, an INSPIRE compliant metadata file is generated for every product and a template for the delivery report is created for each DU and stored in the respective folder.\n\n\n\nFinal Digital Height Model (height values in m)\n\n\n\n\n4.2.11 Minimum mapping units and exceptions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCORINE\nClasses [Lev.

However, no polygon can be smaller than 500 m² (e.g. a 1 ha forest divided in 4 polygons by the road network has to be mapped) except for polygons at the border of the FUA (&gt;100 m²).\nThe minimum mapping width (MinMW) between 2 objects for distinct mapping is 10 m.\nException of minimum width 10m of a mapping unit: class 12220 (MMW = 6m).\nException of minimum width 10m of a mapping unit: to maintain continuity of linear structures, they can be mapped smaller than 10 m over a distance up to 50 m (see figure below).\n\nPriority mapping rules for areas smaller than the MMU:\n\nSmaller areas are visually added to the adjacent unit with the thematically closest class. Rule used for the artificial codes (1xxxx).\nSmaller areas are added to the adjacent unit with the longest common border line, except to railways or roads (exception here: if an object is below the MMU size and completely surrounded by e.g. road or railway network it shall be aggregated with that surrounding traffic line). Rule used for the natural / semi-natural codes (2xxxx, 3xxxx, 4xxxx, 5xxxx) and all the polygons &lt; 100m².\n\nSpecific Minimum Mapping Units for LULC CHANGE layer :\nIn order to ensure that relevant LU/LC changes are appropriately extracted, the MMUs for the LU/LC change layer (e.g. 2012-2018) are defined as below:\n\nUrban (class 1) to urban (class 1) = 0.1 ha\nRural/natural (classes 2-5) to urban (class 1) = 0.1 ha\nRural/natural (classes 2-5) to rural/natural (classes 2-5) = 0.25 ha\nUrban (class 1) to rural/natural (classes 2-5) = 0.25 ha\n\nConsidering this MMUs, exceptions are made in case of areas where changes involve road and railway networks (classes 12210, 12220, 12230); polygon features classified as road or railway for one date or directly connected to such element are extracted even if area is lower than MMU in order to keep consistency of the transportation network.\n\n\n4.2.12 Accuracy assessment and validation\nIn addition to the usual QA/QC procedure implementation, which implies visual checks for ensuring thematic and geometric positional accuracies and automatic checks for ensuring completeness and logical consistency during the post-processing phase of the production, accuracy assessment and validation must be performed independently from the production for providing the evidence that the results are fully compliant with the product specifications.\nThus, accuracy assessment follows a “double-blind” approach which means that production team and reference data team work completely independently. Reference database is obtained through the interpretation of samples which are selected based on a stratified random sampling of EEA 1km grid cell. The number of samples for each FUAs varies depending on the FUA size. The results of the reference interpretation provide the material to derive confusion matrixes, which are used to assess the accuracies.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCORINE\nClasses [Lev.

Thus, the emerging dataset is quality checked several times throughout the process.\nEvery product is accompanied by a DHM QC Report, which shows the results of the external Quality Check and an INSPIRE compliant xml file: Building Height 2012 — Copernicus Land Monitoring Service."

    "text": "4.5 Description of LU/LC thematic classes\n\n1. Artificial surfaces\nSurfaces with dominant human influence and without agricultural land use.\nThese areas include all artificial structures and their associated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces.\nArtificial structures are defined as buildings, roads, all constructions of infrastructure and other artificially sealed or paved areas.\nAssociated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces are areas functionally related to human activities, except agriculture.\nAlso, the areas where the natural surface is replaced by extraction and / or deposition or designed landscapes (such as urban parks or leisure parks) are mapped in this class.\nThe land use is dominated by permanently populated areas and / or traffic, exploration, non-agricultural production, sports, recreation and leisure.\n1.1 URBAN FABRIC\nBuilt-up areas and their associated land, such as gardens, parks, planted areas and non-surfaced public areas and the infrastructure, if these areas are not suitable to be mapped separately regarding the minimum mapping unit size.\nBasically, the classes 1.1.1 and 1.1.2. are distinguished by their degree of soil sealing.\nResidential structures and patterns are predominant, but also downtown areas and city centres, including the Central Business Districts (CBD) and areas with partial residential use, are included.\nThe urban fabric classes (1.1) are distinguished only by their degree of soil sealing not by their type of buildings (single family houses or apartment blocks).\nThe detailed descriptions of the different classes below are given to the interpreters to support the delineation of mapping objects with homogeneous sealing density (without being required to assign the exact density classes).\nUsing the navigation data as a skeleton for the urban area, in many cases it is necessary to subdivide the blocks formed by the navigation data due to the different sealing density of the residential areas or different functions of the buildings and their associated land.\nAfter completion of the interpretation, the sealing level information from the IMD sealing layer is integrated into the data.\n1.1.1 CONTINUOUS URBAN FABRIC\nSpecial note:\nMapping the 3rd level is done only with the defined application of the IMD sealing layer.\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nLand Cover:\nAverage degree of soil sealing:   80%\nBuilt-up areas and their associated land, if these areas are not suitable to be mapped separately regarding the minimum mapping unit size.\nBuildings, roads and sealed areas cover most of the area; non-linear areas of vegetation and bare soil are exceptional.\nLand Use:\nPredominant residential use: areas with a high degree of soil sealing, independent of their housing scheme (single family houses or high-rise dwellings, city centre or suburb).\nIncluded are downtown areas and city centres, and Central Business Districts (CBD) if there is partial residential use.\n1.1.2 DISCONTINUOUS URBAN FABRIC\nSpecial note:\nMapping the 4th level of density classes is done only with the defined application of the imperviousness / soil sealing layer.\nLand Cover:\nAverage degree of imperviousness / soil sealing: 0 - 80%\nBuilt-up areas and their associated land (small roads, sealed areas including non-linear areas of vegetation and bare soil), if these areas are not suitable to be mapped separately regarding the minimum mapping unit size.\nThis type of land cover can be distinguished from continuous urban fabric by a larger fraction of non-sealed and / or vegetated surfaces: gardens, parks, planted areas and non-surfaced public areas.\nLand Use:\nPredominant residential usage. Contains more than 20% non-sealed areas, independent of their housing scheme (single family houses or high-rise dwellings, city centre or suburb).\nThe non-sealed areas might be private gardens or common green areas.\nNot included are:\nFarms with large buildings (agro-industrial production), → class 1.2.1.\nNurseries with dominant areas of greenhouses (no or only small fields) → class 1.2.1.\nAllotment gardens → class 1.4.2.\nHoliday villages (“Club Med”) → class 1.4.2.\n1.1.2.1 DISCONTINUOUS DENSE URBAN FABRIC\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nAverage degree of soil sealing: &gt; 50 - 80%\nResidential buildings, roads and other artificially surfaced areas.\n1.1.2.2 DISCONTINUOUS MEDIUM DENSITY URBAN FABRIC\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nAverage degree of soil sealing: &gt; 30 - 50%\nResidential buildings, roads and other artificially surfaced areas. The vegetated areas are predominant, but the land is not dedicated to forestry or agriculture.\n1.1.2.3 DISCONTINUOUS LOW DENSITY URBAN FABRIC\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nAverage degree of soil sealing: 10 - 30%\nResidential buildings, roads and other artificially surfaced areas. The vegetated areas are predominant, but the land is not dedicated to forestry or agriculture.\n1.1.2.4 DISCONTINUOUS VERY LOW DENSITY URBAN FABRIC\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nAverage degree of soil sealing: &lt;10 %\nResidential buildings, roads and other artificially surfaced areas. The vegetated areas are predominant, but the land is not dedicated to forestry or agriculture. Example: exclusive residential areas with large gardens.\n1.1.3 ISOLATED STRUCTURES\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, Maximum Mapping Unit 2 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nIsolated artificially structures with a residential component, such as (small) individual farmhouses and related buildings.\nIt must contain only a few houses (1 to 5 houses: depending on the size of the houses and the number of associated buildings), otherwise it should be included in class 1.1.2.\nThe mapping unit is no larger than 2 ha, otherwise it should also be included in class 1.1.2.\nTo be in line with this eligibility rule (regarding level 1 of the nomenclature, artificialized areas), if the considered feature is neighbouring another urban class polygon(s) other than transportation network, and the total surface of the considered polygons is above 2 ha, the area should be considered as class 1.1.2 rather than 1.1.3”\nComment : In this kind of areas under development, some small areas are considered as class 1.1.2 (and not 1.1.3) because of the presence of neighbouring areas classified as 1.3.4 (artificial areas).\n1.2 INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, PUBLIC, MILITARY, PRIVATE AND TRANSPORT UNITS\nAt least 30% of the ground is covered by artificial surfaces. More than 50% of those artificial surfaces are occupied by buildings and / or artificial structures with non-residential use, i.e. industrial, commercial or transport related uses are dominant.\n1.2.1 INDUSTRIAL, COMMERCIAL, PUBLIC, MILITARY AND PRIVATE UNITS\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 10 m\n\nLand cover:\nArtificial structures (e.g. buildings) or artificial surfaces (e.g. concrete, asphalt, tar, macadam, tarmac or otherwise stabilized surface, e.g. compacted soil, devoid of vegetation), occupy most of the surface. Included are associated areas, such as roads, sealed areas and vegetated areas, if these areas are not suitable to be mapped separately regarding the MMU size.\nLand use:\nIndustrial, commercial, public, military or private units. The administrative boundaries of the production or service unit are mapped, including associated features larger than the MMU (e.g. sports areas or transport structures).\nAlso included are:\n&gt; Bare soil and/or grassland potentially used for storage of material or as enclosures for livestock.\n&gt; Compounds with significant amounts of green or natural areas but with industrial, commercial, military or public use. Example: communication tower, antennas or wind motors and their associated land.\nThis class contains:\n\nIndustrial uses and related areas\n\n&gt; Sites of industrial activities, including their related areas such as storage areas.\n&gt; Production sites.\n&gt; Energy plants: nuclear, solar, hydroelectric, thermal, electric and wind farms.\n&gt; Sewage treatment plants.\n&gt; Farming industries (farms with large buildings and / or greenhouses).\n&gt; Antennas, even with predominant vegetated areas. The vegetated areas may be predominant, but the land is not dedicated to forestry or agriculture.\n&gt; Water treatment plants.\n&gt; Sewage plants.\n&gt; Seawater desalination plants.\nThe industrial units can be distinguished from residential built-up areas by the type of buildings, their access to transport features and the surroundings:\n&gt; Buildings with large surface areas (inside, not all rooms need daylight, as in dwelling houses).\n&gt; Good access to roads and parking for customers.\n&gt; Industrial areas are often outside the historical city centre.\n\nCommercial uses, retail parks and related areas\n\n&gt; Surfaces purely occupied by commercial activities, including their related areas (e.g. parking areas even larger than the MMU).\n&gt; High-rise office buildings.\n&gt; Petrol and service stations within built-up areas.\nThe commercial units can be distinguished from residential built-up areas by the type of large buildings, their access to transport features and the surroundings:\n&gt; Buildings with large surface areas (inside, not all rooms need daylight, as in dwelling houses).\n&gt; Good access to roads and parking for customers.\n&gt; Pure commercial areas are often outside the historical city centre.\nNot included are:\nPetrol stations along fast transit and main roads with access only from these roads. They are mapped together with the road transport system → class 1.2.2.1 or 1.2.2.2.\n\nPublic, military and private services not related to the transport system\n\nSurfaces purely occupied by general government, public or private administrations including their related areas (access ways, lawns, military training areas, parking areas).\nIncluded are:\n&gt; Schools and universities.\n&gt; Hospitals and other health services or buildings.\n&gt; Places of worship (churches / cathedrals / religious buildings).\n&gt; Archaeological sites and museums.\n&gt; Administration buildings, ministries.\n&gt; Penitentiaries.\n&gt; Military areas including bases and ports.\n&gt; Military exercise areas fenced and under current use.\n&gt; Castles, etc. not primarily used for residential purposes (building management, gardeners, etc…. living there is not residential use in this sense).\n&gt; Private storage areas without a residential component, such as compounds of garages.\nNot included are:\n&gt; Public parks → class 1.4.1.\n&gt; Holiday resorts including their hotels → class 1.4.2.\n&gt; Sport centres or bathing centres → class 1.4.2.\n&gt; Cemeteries → class 1.4.1 (note: for the “UA 2006” LULC production, the cemeteries were classified in class 1.2.1, they are now included in class 1.4.1 in “UA 2006 Revised” and “UA 2012” LCLU).\n&gt; Military airports → class 1.2.4.\n\nCivil protection and supply infrastructure\n\n&gt; Dams, dikes, irrigation and drainage canals and ponds and other technical public infrastructure, to be mapped with the roads, embankments and associated land included.\n&gt; Includes also breakwaters, piers and jetties, sea walls and flood defenses.\n&gt; (Ancient) city walls, other protecting walls, bunkers.\n&gt; Avalanche barriers.\nNot included are:\nNoise barriers → class 1.2.2.\nWater courses (within e.g. diked canals) if the water area is wider than 10 m → class 5; Reservoirs along natural water courses → class 5.\n1.2.2 ROAD AND RAIL NETWORK AND ASSOCIATED LAND\n\nMMU 0.25 ha, MinMW: 6 m (Road) - 10 m (Rail)\n\nSpecial Note:\nThe road and railway network (COTS or OSM data) is ingested into the classification database according to the method given in the Annex.\nParts of the navigation data that are obviously not congruent with the corresponding traffic line in the EO data and ancillary map need to be corrected.\nRoads which are not contained in the navigation data are mapped by the service provider according to the mapping criteria defined in this mapping guide.\nRoads or railways do not necessarily have to form a closed network.

However, delineation of water areas must be done using the EO data, as the geometric accuracy of a OSM data water object is too rough for mapping on the scale 1:10 000.\nNot included are:\nShallow water areas covered with reed &gt; MMU → class 2 Seasonal rivers, if the water course is not visible in the EO data → class 2.\n\n\n6. Miscellaneous\nConcerning the UA2006 products, areas with EO data provision problems were classified in separate classes described below.\n\nNo data (Clouds and shadows)\n\n\nAreas affected by clouds or shadows on the EO data have to be mapped with ancillary data if the cloud or/and shadow overlays with the “CGC_RG_LAEA” layer (priority areas corresponding to the cities and greater cities according to the EC/OECD definition of cities (2011) provided by DG REGIO). An additional layer called “CGC_CLOUD_CAPI” delineating the areas classified by other data sources (Google Earth or other relevant available data sources) than the VHR2 coverage (DWH_MG2b_CORE_03) will be produced.\nOutside these priority areas, class 9.1 (code 91000) will be used for areas covered by clouds and shadows over the satellite images where land use/land cover is not possible to be determined.\n\nNo data (Missing imagery)\n\n\nThis class 9.2 (code 92000) includes areas without available satellite image or inadequate imagery (e.g. no STL data can be produced as the image acquisition is outside the vegetation period)."

    "text": "6.1 Pre-processing and geometric adaptation of navigation data\nThe navigation datasets (COTS or OSM) by default include a specific and hierarchical classification of the road network. Two basic categories are important within the context of the Urban Atlas. The first category gives information about the Functional Road Class (FRC), i.e. the road type, the second one gives information about the importance of each road within the city traffic network (Net2Class).\nThe navigation data currently used shows the following categories for FRC/type and Net2Class:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFRC (COTS)\nType (OSM)\nFull name\n\n\n\n\n0\nmotorway\nMotorway, Freeway or another Major Road\n\n\n1\ntrunk\nMajor Road less important than a Motorway\n\n\n2\ntrunk_link\nOther Major Road\n\n\n3\nprimary\nSecondary Road\n\n\n4\nsecondary\nLocal Connecting Road\n\n\n5\nsecondary_link\nLocal Road of high importance\n\n\n6\ntertiary\nLocal Road\n\n\n7\nresidential, service, unclassified\nLocal Road of minor importance\n\n\n8\ntrack, path, steps, cycleway\nOther Road\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNet2Class\nImportance Level\n\n\n\n\n0\nFirst class (Highest)\n\n\n1\nSecond class\n\n\n2\nThird class\n\n\n3\nFourth class\n\n\n4\nFifth class\n\n\n5\nSixth class\n\n\n6\nSeventh class (Lowest)\n\n\n\nUSAGE OF NAVIGATION DATA FOR THE URBAN ATLAS\nThe navigation data (COTS or OSM) will be used to generate the street and railroad network of the mapping product. This network will serve as a “backbone” and is decisive for the look and feel of the final product.\nThe data is delivered in line vector format by the data provider. These lines need to be widened so that the traffic line network of the final product covers the transport areas in the EO data.\nFor that purpose, a usage and buffering strategy was developed to implement the navigation data into the product.\nThe integration of the traffic network shall be done in advance of all other visual or (semi) automatic delineation and labelling of objects.\nThe goal of the traffic line implementation process is to ingest a traffic line network into the mapping product that covers all traffic lines wider than 10 m (including their associated land – see traffic line description: class 1.2.2) and – on the other hand – is COTS-efficient to integrate.\nTo achieve that goal the following strategy was developed:\n\nThe railway network is delineated individually if it exceeds a minimum width of 10 m including its associated land.\nThe most important roads (FRC classes 0, 1) will be delineated individually.\nMost of the roads (FRC classes 2 to 5) will be ingested by buffering the line vectors. The buffered roads will have an overall width of at least 10 m. The buffering width for each FRC class will be adapted to the local conditions of each individual city to resemble the overall characteristics of the local traffic network.\nCertain roads (FRC class 6 and above) will be mapped if available (by buffering) or left out according to the decision of the service provider. This is to preserve a common look and feel of the mapping products of different cities.\n\nThe following table gives an overview of the road network processing approach:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFRC\nNet2Class 1\nNet2Class 2\nNet2Class 3\nNet2Class 4\n\n\n\n\n0\nManual\n\n\n\n\n\n1\nManual\n\n\n\n\n\n2\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\n\n\n3\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\n\n\n4\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\n\n\n5\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\nEstimated buffer width\n\n\n6 and above\nMapping decided on city by city basis\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe general procedure for the road buffering is as follows:\nPRE-PROCESSING\n\nIdentification of the different combinations for fields Net2Class and FRC.\nDecision whether to include FRC=6 or not based on visual inspection.\nSampling of several streets (up to service provider) for each combination.\nEstimation of mean width for each combination.\nThe use of VHR imagery (e.g. Google Earth) is recommended. If the city is not available in VHR, a city with similar morphology in the same country may be used along with the EO data for production.\n\nPROCESSING\n\nBuffering implementation.\nManual delineation of streets FRC=0 and 1.\n\nPOST-PROCESSING\n\nManual delineation of streets wider than 10 m that have not been buffered previously (i.e. not present in the street network layer or belonging to combinations not considered for buffering).\nCorrection (elimination / edition) of errors due to inaccuracies of the line street network or buffering process.\n\nPost-processing will be implemented according to service provider’s production chain."

The Riparian Zones product can facilitate the identification of areas where challenges possibly related to degraded riparian zones, overlap with areas where riparian zones should or could be present. This can inform efforts in either reintroducing riparian zones or improving existing riparian zones and can highlight where the benefit of restoring riparian zones would be greatest, see more in section Use case: Ecosystem types of Europe. Well managed riparian zones can hinder pesticides, pollutants, and excessive nutrients from reaching water streams and downstream water sources. This in turn improves the quality of water sources and streams by limiting eutrophication and reducing the amount of treatment required for water in water treatment plants. Reduced eutrophication improves the oxygen levels and habitats for aquatic life and thus improves biodiversity as well as the water quality overall, see more in section Use case: Improving water quality and protecting against flooding.\nThrough sustainable management of water sources, governments can assist local communities, support the private sector and encourage important synergies between healthy ecosystems and human well-being. The Riparian Zones product can aid adaptive management with appropriate monitoring and assessment on the current state.\nHealthy riparian zones also retain water masses during flooding and other high-water events, reducing the energy and velocity of water which impedes the risk of flooding damage to infrastructure downstream but may also play a role in limiting wild fires. The riparian zones maintain stable river banks by means of vegetation roots, which prevents sediment build-up and extreme bank erosion, which otherwise could cause damages downstream, see more in section Use case: Potential Flood Plains and Use case: Improving water quality and protecting against flooding.\nRiparian zones in addition provide recreational values such as canoeing, hiking, camping, bird watching and fishing, which are important for the wellbeing of inhabitants and may attract ecotourism, although care should be taken to combine these activities with keeping the riparian zone as undisturbed as possible by traffic and in a naturally vegetated state, see more in section Use case: Ecosystem services and informing policies and conservation measures and Use case: Biodiversity and birds.\nRiparian zones also provide educational opportunities [1], bringing students of all ages into nature to observe and learn about the benefits provided by these areas and how best to aid in their management and preservation, see section Use case: Ecosystem services and informing policies and conservation measures.\nPrivate sector\nThe private sector could utilize the information available through the Riparian Zones product by adapting their businesses to protect and improve nearby riparian zones to increase the ecological value of their land as well as its sustainability. Private agricultural and farming areas could utilise the information of the benefits that riparian zones provide, such as increased biodiversity and habitats for, among other, pollinators which are beneficial for crops [10]. Other benefits may include reduced impacts from pest species, resulting in less need for use of pesticides [11] and thus a higher water quality. The private sector such as consultancies can use the freely available Riparian Zones product to improve the quality of their services. Well-informed decisions made in terms of different kinds of development increase the likelihood of holistic and sustainable solutions.\nThe Riparian Zones product could inform the private sector, as well as the public, on where action in relation to other interventions in infrastructure, development or restoration projects, can achieve multiple benefits and synergies in for example quality improvement of biodiversity, water, habitats. Additionally the Riparian Zones product could be used to make more detailed assessments on the state of the riparian zone through field research. With this knowledge informed and targeted efforts to improve the ecosystem services can be implemented. Private companies such as map providers could also incorporate the riparian zones data into their existing maps to meet demands from certain interest groups but also raise awareness of its importance in the general public.\nPrivate interest groups\nCivil society can, through various interest organisations, NGO’s, academic organisations, scouts and social movements and campaigns – benefit from the information freely available through the Riparian Zones product, to mobilise or inform the general public on the importance of riparian zones and the benefits they provide. This may in turn spark an increased incentive for each citizen to take measures where they are able, to protect and improve these areas. Private interest groups in bird watching and fishing could use the provided information from the Riparian Zones product to localise and improve good breeding grounds and migration routes for both fish and birds. Extreme temperatures are moderated in riparian zones due to large mature trees and overhanging vegetation, fallen trees also provide shelter and habitat for fish and insects. This creates favourable habitats for both water- and land-living species. [12] Disturbed or degraded riparian zones offer possibilities for restoring wildlife habitat functions. Wildlife management groups might use the information in the Riparian Zones product for researching hot spots for wildlife and plant migration, which in part ties together fragmented habitats and allows for healthier populations of otherwise perhaps threatened species. The information provided can be used in combination with requirements for specific species in terms of restoring threatened species to healthy populations. Certain wildlife species for example require riparian zones of significant widths to breed, migrate between habitats, feed, nest and disperse to set up new territories [11] [12]. Other species such as fish require the stream to have a minimum number of stream crossings, and where necessary bridges rather than culverts, to migrate and breed. Wider riparian zones in general harbours a wider range of wildlife species, and the larger wildlife species as well as birds generally require the widest riparian zones. The Riparian Zones product can thus be used in informing preservation groups to protect and re-establish populations of certain species of interest, by locating either suitable existing riparian zones where the species occur naturally to reintroduce these species there – or in order to inform interventions to widen existing riparian zones to make them suitable habitats for native species which have decreased in number of even disappeared altogether. Native ecosystems with high biodiversity and low degree of human disturbances, as well as a wide and complex riparian zone, have been shown to be more robust against the introduction of invasive species [13] [14], and support a number of ecosystem services which invasive species will not. However, high biodiversity may also indicate a high introduction and establishment of invasive species, called propagule pressure, and suggests a higher level of invasion of an area. A high number of introduced and established invasive species is for most species, plants and terrestrial animals, linked to high degree of human disturbance. [15] Specific interest groups such as the Intergovernmental Science-Policy Platform on Biodiversity and Ecosystem Services (IPBES) could very well use the product for in their assessments on the state of biodiversity and of the ecosystem services it provides to society. IPBES is an independent intergovernmental body established by States to strengthen the science-policy interface for biodiversity and ecosystem services for the conservation and sustainable use of biodiversity, long-term human well-being and sustainable development.\nPressure from interest groups can in turn influence policy making and political decision-making.\nThe research community could use the product for identifying hot spots for research on biodiversity, ecosystem services, migration patterns, climate change adaptation, climate change impacts and theirs impacts on riparian zones. The Riparian Zones product could be an interesting tool in assessing riparian zones’ ability to adapting to or counteracting climate change effects as it is not clear as of today if these areas are particularly vulnerable to climate change due to their exposure; or if they are resilient due to their evolution during highly variable climates and environments [16]."

    "section": "4.2 Use cases",
    "text": "4.2 Use cases\n\n4.2.1 Use case: Potential Flood Plains\nThe European Environment Agency has produced a report which aims to provide an overview of the different aspects of floodplain management and to provide examples of the services that are important for the healthy functioning of floodplains [6]. The Riparian Zones product has been used as input to this report.\nFloodplains cover 7% of Europe’s landmass. These are part of its natural capital, covering up to 30% of the terrestrial Natura 2000 site areas. Studies have shown that 70-90% of floodplains have been environmentally degraded. [6] Many European policies are relevant for floodplains and flood prone areas, for example the Water Framework Directive, the Habitats and Birds Directives, and the Floods Directive. The floodplains represent the transition between land and freshwater ecosystems, with hydrology, soil and biotic conditions strongly influenced by stream water and flooding. Additionally they provide a range of important ecosystem services such as nutrient and water retention, flood control, carbon sequestration, a diversity of aquatic and wetland habitats, but they are under pressure. [17] Riparian zones constitute an integral part of flood plains.\nThe severe degradation worldwide of freshwater ecosystems has posed a major threat to ecosystem services of floodplains, riparian zones and vegetation. This negative trend that has continued to increase for centuries due to changed land use patterns and might even be intensified because of climate change [10]. Therefore, restoration of floodplains and riparian zones would prove an important measure to mitigate the effects of such degradation.\nThe Riparian Zones product can be used to inform efforts to show that natural and restored floodplains provide an alternative to structural measures for providing flood protection, and at the same time support achieving higher quality ecosystem services like improved water quality, improved conditions for biodiversity conservation and higher recreational value. [6]\n\n\n4.2.2 Use case: Improving water quality and protecting against flooding\nRiparian zones provide an important function for waterways as a buffer between catchment areas and water recipients, through filtering catchment water from pollutants or excessive nutrients [13]. Restoring and improving riparian zones can act as an important measure in improving water quality and ecosystems in for example agricultural areas or otherwise managed land areas, in alignment with the Water Framework Directive (WFD) [18] but also target 7 and 10 in First draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework [19] and the Sustainable Development Goal (SDG) 6 [20].\nIn addition, the riparian zones act a protection against flooding events, working towards target 11 in First draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework [19]. Human development in riparian zones has put pressure on the environmental roles that floodplains and riparian zones play during flooding events, and human made structural protections against floods in these areas have further exacerbated the problems [6]. With increasing populations living in riparian zones and more and more extreme weather events occurring, the need for restoration, protection and sustainable management of still functioning riparian zones increases, to protect more regions and people from the imminent risk of floods [21], in alignment with the Floods Directive [22].\nTo restore riparian zones, river hydromorphology and sustainable river management, and not least to overbridge the gap left in different hydromorphological assessment policies concerning the importance of riparian vegetation, tools for assessment of the state of riparian vegetation are needed [23]. Using the Riparian Zones product to compare the extent of riparian zones from one year to another, can provide an indication of the progress in improving the ecosystem services from riparian zones, but also the progress in the protection against climate change impacts and resilience towards flooding events [6].\n\n\n4.2.3 Use case: Ecosystem types of Europe\nThe Riparian Zones product has been used as input contributing to a better biological characterization of terrestrial and marine ecosystems across Europe (EEA-39), through the dataset “Ecosystem types of Europe” [24]. It represents probabilities of EUNIS (European Nature Information System) habitat presence in terrestrial, freshwater and marine ecosystems. The work supports the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES), Action 5 of Target 2 the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2020, established to achieve the Aichi targets of the Convention of Biological Diversity (CBD). [25]\n\n\n4.2.4 Use case: Ecosystem services and informing policies and conservation measures\nRiparian zones provide cultural services in the form of for example recreation, aesthetic, spiritual and educational benefits; provisional services in the form of physical products such as for example biomass and genetic resources; and regulation and maintenance services such as for example filtration of pollutants and chemical conditions of freshwaters, carbon sequestration, flow regulation, erosion control, pollination and seed dispersal, pest control, maintenance of nursery populations and habitats, regulation of microclimate and fire effects mitigation. [10] Because of the functions these areas provide in terms of water provision, they are under threat from urbanisation and other human activities and land uses.\nThe Riparian Zones product may aid in the efforts of monitoring progress in restoring riparian zones due to the improved technique for data collection, which is important both for feedback and guidance on how to evaluate the different strategies applied [26]. Riparian zones are often characterised by inaccessibility and dynamism [26], making a tool for monitoring the development of riparian zones through visual interpretation of vector data and satellite imagery an invaluable tool to assess successes and potential for optimisation in management and restoration efforts.\nMany indicators of riparian zone status can be monitored by remote sensing data, as is done in the Riparian Zones product. Examples of these indicators are water level width, riparian zone area, vegetation coverage, river connectivity and natural wetland conservation, which are closely related to riparian vegetation density, bedload transport capacity, flow regulation and biological abundance which are in turn crucial to the physical habitat. [26]\nRiparian zones are, despite their importance in water quality and flood mitigation, not specifically mentioned in the EU Floods Directive (FD) or the EU Water Framework Directive (WFD). The management of these dynamic socio-ecological systems require dynamic adaptive policies, and monitoring of riparian zones make an important cornerstone in achieving this. [21] The Riparian Zones product can prove an important aid in achieving policies more specifically targeted at restoring, protecting and optimising management of these areas, to protect habitats and biodiversity as well as the many ecosystem services that these areas provide. Monitoring and assessment are important factors in evaluating the effectiveness of policy making and optimising for the best possible results, given the complexity of the riparian zone ecosystems and interconnections, this aspect proves yet more important.\n\n\n4.2.5 Use case: Biomass production\nAgricultural areas located nearby riparian zones and streams could by own measures improve it by restoring native vegetation and keeping grazing cattle away from the stream to allow for vegetation to settle, stabilise the river banks and strengthen native species and ecosystems while also protecting downstream land from flooding. Used in combination with for example the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) [27], and its three \"specific objectives\"1 concerning the environment and climate, useful synergies can be achieved. Additionally, riparian zones adjacent to agricultural land could be used for biomass generation with energy crop cultivations in order to meet the ever-increasing demand for renewable energy sources in climate change adaptation efforts [28]. This would increase the environmental benefits in the riparian zone, whilst maintaining productivity of the agricultural areas and achieving biomass outputs.\n\n\n4.2.6 Use case: Biodiversity and birds\nThe vegetation cover and availability of food resources make riparian zones important habitats to many birds [29]. Due to their sensitivity to changes in the environment, birds are sentinel species which allow to detect environmental hazards, providing an early warning of different threats such as pollution, habitat quality, overall biodiversity, or emerging diseases. As climate and weather indicators, birds can be useful tools to monitor the impacts of climate change at large spatial scales. [30] Habitat loss and degradation are the most serious threats to the conservation of wild birds [31].\nThus preserving and restoring riparian zones can provide an important measure to maintain and restore the populations of both native and migrating birds. Additionally long-term spatial variation on bird migration represents an interesting approach to indirectly identify environmental consequences of climate change across the globe. [30]\nThe connection between bird watching and the recreational attractiveness of riparian zones provides an opportunity for the Riparian Zones product to support the aim of the Copernicus Bird Migration project, which is in part to “raise awareness among the general public of the effects of climate variations and the power and range of climate data available, to ultimately inform decision-making”. [30]\nSeveral habitats and species listed in the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) are found on active floodplains, as are birds listed within the Birds Directive (2009/147/EC). Restoring riparian zones would likely improve the conservation status assessments of these habitats and species, while also possibly increase connectivity between habitats and counteract habitat fragmentation [28]. Riparian forests are important nature types for providing connection between and counteracting fragmentation of Natura2000 woodland habitats [32] but also by providing ecological corridors for animals and plants which is important in conservation and nature management efforts [33]. This is especially important in areas where there is artificial land uses and agricultural areas which the forest species need to migrate across [32] but also for implementing restoration or conservation efforts through policy-making, or conducting habitat assessments [33] [1]. The Riparian Zones product has also been used to evaluate its suitability to measure the longitudinal connectivity of riparian forests and the capacity of riparian zones to provide Ecosystem Services (ES) [34].\nInvasive species are positively correlated with river management practices where the velocity, water depth and the distance to the water source is altered [13], thus advocating for water management practices which promote a return towards the original ecosystem, including riparian zones, may promote the biodiversity in native species [6]. This also aligns with target 6 in the First draft of the post-2020 global biodiversity framework [19] “A New Global Framework for Managing Nature Through 2030”, the successor to the UN Aichi biodiversity target 9 (of preventing and controlling invasive alien species and reducing direct pressures on biodiversity)."

The product file name is composed of the following name constituents:\nTHEME_DELIVERY UNIT ID_PRODUCT_VERSION\nwith the following detailed meanings:\n\nTHEME (3-letter abbreviation)\n\n'rpz' = \"Riparian Zones\"\n\n\nDELIVERY UNIT ID (6-letter)\n\n'DU001A' = \"Delivery Unit DU001A\" (A = All; full delivery)\n'DU002A' = \"Delivery Unit DU002A\" (A = All; full delivery)\n'DU003B' = \"Delivery Unit DU003B\" (B - Z = partial delivery)\n\nPRODUCT (4-letter abbreviation)\n\n'lclu' = \"Land Cover / Land Use Classification\"\n'2012_2018' = \"Reference years\"\n\nVERSION\n\n'v01' = \"Version 1\"\n'v02' = \"Version 2\"\n'v03' = \"Version 3\"\n\nDATA FORMAT\n\n‘.shp’ = “ESRI shapefile format”\n\n\n\nExample: rpz_DU001A_lclu_2012_2018_v03.shp\nDelivery Units\nRZ products have been produced for the whole EEA-39 plus Andorra and the Vatican City. Since Strahler 2 data has been included, the AoI covers further areas that were excluded during the previous phases because of absence of river Strahler 3 to 9 at Azores and Canary Islands. The French DOMs are still excluded from the current production.\nThe data is delivered on a Delivery Unit level. The hydrologically meaningful Delivery Units are based on aggregated sub-basins of EEA’s European Catchment and Rivers Network System (ECRINS v1.1), clipped to the GISCO boundaries in scale 1:100,000 and are presented in Figure 2. Delivery Units, corresponding RZ AoI area and the associated catchments are provided in Table 11 in the Annex section.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: The 43 Riparian Zones Delivery Units (based on ECRINS v1.1)\n\n\nNomenclature\nThe Nomenclature for the LC/LU dataset is in accordance with the MAES ecosystem typed. Table 3 shows the main classes at CODE Level 1-4 which form the basis for the CODE classes of the RZ nomenclature.\nThe nomenclature is then subdivided in several classes up to CODE level 4, with a total of 56 classes. The RZ CODE classes have been restructured as part of the harmonization of CLMS local component products. In Table 3 below the updated RZ nomenclature is shown.\nThe detailed nomenclature guidelines are found in RZ Nomenclature Guideline v1.3: 06/06/18 (copernicus.eu).\n\n\n\n\nTable 3: Detailed Nomenclature for the LC/LU dataset\nMetadata\nMetadata are provided together with the products as Infrastructure for Spatial Information in Europe (INSPIRE)-compliant Extensible Markup Language (XML) files according to the EEA Metadata Standard for Geographic Information (MSGI). EEA-MSGI has been developed by EEA to meet needs and demands for inter-operability of metadata. EEA’s standard for metadata is a profile of the ISO/TC 19139:2007standard for geographic metadata and contains more elements than the minimum required to comply the INSPIRE metadata regulation.\nDetailed conceptual specifications on EEA-MSGI and other relevant information on metadata can be found at: http://www.eionet.europa.eu/gis.\nFor validation of metadata EEA Spatial Data Infrastructure (SDI) metadata editor was used, which can be found at: https://sdi.eea.europa.eu/editor-catalogue/srv/eng/catalog.search#/home.\nMetadata validation was performed using EEA SDI editor validation function and the external INSPIRE validator which can be accessed at: https://inspire.ec.europa.eu/validator/.\nParent Scene Identification Layer (PSIL)2\nThe Parent Scene Identification Layer (PSIL) is an auxiliary vector file delivered together with dataset deliveries. It is provided as a one single Esri shapefile, projected in ETRS89/ETRS-LAEA (EPSG:3035) for the whole area of the RZ project. The PSIL fully covers the AoI and provides the main EO data input used for generating the map product for every location within the AoI. In case no suitable EO data is found the [NoData] field is activated. The main aim of the PSIL is to guarantee a reproducible data situation for any post production activities. It provides the spatial extent of the satellite image used for the image interpretation for both reference years.\nThe PSIL should allow to:\n\nIdentify the main EO dataset used to produce any polygons in the map.

This was done to also cover some still missing parts of Strahler 3-8, bringing the total area to a larger spatial extension.\nThis amendment has been created, GIS-based, in a semi-automatic way, including certain manual refinements. Such are required to account for omissions of riparian features caused by (i) imprecisions of input data sets, (ii) deviations specifically between the input EU-Hydro versions used in the previous phase and the current Riparian Zones mapping (beta version vs. public beta 0.9), and to (iii) seamlessly match the new, extended AoI with the existing “old” AoI.\nThe implementation of the amendment (fine-tuning) was done Delivery Unit per Delivery Unit. The resulting AoI constitutes the basis for subsequently deriving the land cover/land use of those areas for the reference years 2012 and 2018 and compilation of the LC/LU change layer 2012-2018.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: AoI amendment example of Str-2 hanging rivers connected to Str. 3\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: AoI amendment to include Lake Outline"

    "text": "6.2 EO Data Specifications\nThe ESA DWH dataset DWH_MG2b_CORE_03 (Optical VHR2 coverage over EU 2011-2013 and Riparian zones) represents the primary data source for the LC/LU mapping task in the Riparian Zones for the reference year 2012. Detailed specifications of the used satellite data can be reviewed in the latest Copernicus Space Component Data Access Portfolio (DAP) document (Issue 2, Revision 5 of 14/12/2018), available at: https://spacedata.copernicus.eu/.\nHowever, due to gaps within the vegetation season of the relevant ESA DHW CORE_03 VHR datasets, an additional data provision was indispensable for the project to ensure feasibility of mapping the requested LC/LU product from a cloud-free VHR data coverage of the AoI, within the vegetation season.\nTherefore, to further reduce the remaining coverage gaps, access to “non-standard” DWH VHR datasets (typically individual, tailored datasets of small extent, previously acquired for other project’s specific purposes) has been offered and partially made available by ESA.\nThe VHR_IMAGE_2015 dataset was also considered, however incorporating only data acquired in 2014 (since for the reference year 2012, only data within the range 2010 - 2014 are eligible).\nAll considered VHR missions had to fulfil certain mission specifications to be eligible for this selection, to ensure suitability for subsequent LC/LU mapping and to ensure consistency to the previous RZ phases as far as feasible:\n\nMultispectral bands (incl. Near InfraRed (NIR))\nSpatial resolution better or equal 2,5m (resolution-/pan-merge is eligible), corresponding to DAP VHR2 (archive) category\nAcquisition within (extended) vegetation period\nAbsence of Clouds, cloud shadows and haze (over the AoI, to large extent)\nOff-Nadir angle lower or equal than 30°\n\nAccording to these requirements, the following eligible Copernicus Contribution Missions (CCMs) were considered (see Table 7).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCCM (2012) – VHR2\n\n\n\n\nSPOT-5 (2.5m pan-merge)\nSPOT-6 (1.5m pan-merge)\nSPOT-7 (1.5m pan-merge)\nPHR1A – Pléiades-1A (2m multispectral)\nPHR1B – Pléiades-1B (2m multispectral)\nWV02 – WorldView-2 (2m multispectral)\nQB02 – QuickBird-2 (2.4m multispectral)\nGE01 – GeoEye-1 (2m multispectral)\n\n\n\nTable 7: VHR2 CCM considered for scene searches\nAll remaining gaps after this step were entered into a gap-filling VHR scene search which generated the D2_MG2b_NARA_011b dataset which enabled the completion of the AoI of 807.177 km².\nAn almost cloud-free VHR optical dataset covering EEA-39 (VHR_IMAGE_2018), as available through the ESA DWH as well, was used for the status layer 2018 production. Its VHR imagery was acquired within predefined time windows corresponding to the vegetation season 2018 (±1 year), with a spectral resolution comprising visible and NIR bands. It is a mix of primary missions (Pléiades 1A & 1B, SuperView-1, KOMPSat-3/3-A and PlanetScope) and backup missions (SPOT-6/-7, TripleSat and Deimos-2) at a spatial resolution of 2-4m. Where small gaps are still present, Sentinel 2 data is being used to complete the whole area.\nIn Q1 2020 the VHR_IMAGE_2018_ENHANCED dataset was provided to complement the VHR_IMAGE_2018 in regions with lower resolved image data. This subset, acquired within an acquisition window of vegetation season 2018 (±1 year) and consisting of 2m Pléiades 1A/1B, SuperView-1, Kompsat-3/3A image data, was integrated into ongoing production of the RZ products."

    "section": "6.3 Methodology",
    "text": "6.3 Methodology\nThis section provides a generic overview of the applied algorithms and methodology used to derive the Riparian Zones Land Cover and Land Use products for 2012 and 2018. The methodological approach consists of the following main steps:\n\nData preparation & management:\n\n\nCreation of cloud-/shadow masks for cloudy/hazy scenes (for 2012 data).\nPreparation of Open Street Map (OSM) and national datasets.\nPreparation of Urban Atlas 2012/2018 (plus other possible placeholders such as UA2006 and CLC 2006/2012), as explained below.\nHarmonized nomenclature and borders to have a single uniform Strahler 2-9 dataset.\nSetup of a spatial database per delivery unit with its specific final integrated RZ AoI and creation of working sub-areas “Working Units” (WU) to be processed\n\n\nThematic processing comprising the following steps:\n\n\nSemi-automatic thematic classification with supervised and unsupervised elements (Seed & Grow), leading to scene-based binary masks of water (performed only on original 2012 status layer). Interactive manual correction of the derived water masks (performed on 2012 layer)\nVisual interpretation of CODE level 4 classes in line with the Nomenclature Guidelines v. 1.5. It was done first only for 2012 and later, in a different phase, for change layer 2012-2018 and status layer 2018 (for both reference years).\nUpdate 2012 layer for correctly mapping changes where needed.\nIntegration of UA2012/2018 data of Urban Atlas (UA) urban centres (as shown in following chapter)\n\n\nInternal quality control of the classification results\nFinal validation and quality control (consistency, nomenclature, plausibility checks, topological checks, ensuring OGC compliant geometric checks)\nCreation of INSPIRE compliant metadata\nQuantitative accuracy assessment (Stratified Random Point Sampling)\nParent Scene Identification Layer (PSIL) shall be provided covering the whole AoI for both reference years (2012 and 2018)\n\nUrban Atlas Integration\nIn order to avoid mapping areas twice, Urban Atlas 2012/2018 data within UA Urban centres (not the whole Functional Urban Areas - FUA) was foreseen as input data for the RZ project.\nThe UA2012/UA2018 data is directly clipped into the Urban centres included into the Riparian Zones production for the respective reference years 2012 and 2018. As the nomenclature is slightly different, the UA codes have been adapted to the RZ nomenclature following the guide shown in Table 8 below. Not all the codes have a direct translation.\nIn cases where the UA2018 is not totally covering the Urban centre areas, due to changes between the production areas of UA2012 and UA2018 (FUA2012/2018), formerly integrated UA2012 data (1st version provided by EEA in 2017) is used as a gap filler within the limits of the UA Urban centres for reference year 2018. Urban centres of URAU 2012 that were completely excluded from the UA2018 production have been remapped as part of the RZ LC/LU mapping.\n\n\n\nTable 8: Recoding of the UA Core areas into the RZ Nomenclature\n\n\nThis results in a mapping product composed from two different sources: UA urban centre areas coming from UA products and the new mapping areas in the rest of the RZ AoI and surrounding these UA urban centres, as in Figure 5 below.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: UA2012/2018 Integration into the RZ project\n\n\nTo ensure a comparable quality of the Riparian Zones product (LC/LU) and a common look and feel of the data sets produced and provided by different Service Providers, a set of mapping and digitizing rules have been developed.\nThe mapping rules for the LC/LU product are separately presented in the Riparian Zones Nomenclature Guideline issue 1.5 (issued 14.12.2021). The main mapping rules are however summarized below.\nObject Delineation\nObject delineation is performed on VHR EO data as primary data source. In areas, where two or more satellite scenes overlap, the scene within vegetation period closest to the reference years (2012 and 2018) or with best usability for visual interpretation (spatial resolution, data quality) is chosen as primary data source. An exception of this rule (closest to reference year) is made in northern and southern European regions, where images acquired during shortened / extended vegetation period were preferred if a selection of data was available, to support an optimum object discrimination.\nIn cases where clouds or cloud shadows cover the area of interest, for reference year 2012, either overlapping neighbouring SPOT-5/6 data or DWH_MG2b_CORE_03‐Optical VHR SPOT (Satellite Pour l’Observation de la Terre) images acquired outside the preferred acquisition window from May-September are used. But also DWH_MG2_CORE_01 Coverage 1 (IRS-P6, 25 m) and Coverage 2 (RapidEye, 5 m) scenes or Landsat-8 data are employed in case no other adequate data source is available. In similar cases of clouds or shadows for reference year 2018, overlapping scenes of VHR_IMAGE_2018 data set were used or, where data availability is limited, scenes of nominal Sentinel-2 acquisition were used for regionally confined gap filling (narrow EO data gaps limited to widths of ~ hundred meters).\nDelineation Rules\nObject delineation, is performed as follows:\n\nDelineation shall be angular and not round\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Delineation avoiding smooth lines\n\n\n\nAvoid digitizing too many vertices: Use as few vertices as possible and only as many as necessary to define the shape of an object\nAvoid mapping sharp angles\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Delineation avoiding acute angles\n\n\n\nUse road centre (roads &lt;10 m width) as border between two objects if roads separate two features. E.g. a forest and an agricultural area which are separated by a road feature &lt;10 m width leads to mapping the border between forest and agriculture in the middle of the road.\n\n\nMinimum Mapping Unit (MMU)/ Minimum Mapping Width (MMW)\nThe minimum mapping unit defined is 0,5 ha for all objects. A minimum mapping width of 10 m is required for all linear features.\nMMU Exceptions:\nObjects located at the border of the riparian zone:\n\nIf an object is cut by the riparian border and the portion lying inside the RZ therefore is &lt;0,5 ha, this feature is mapped, if the whole object (inside and outside the RZ) amounts to ≥0,5 ha. However, the area of the divided features inside the RZ must be at least ≥0,2 ha. Smaller objects will be generalised if no further MMU exception rule applies. These polygons will get the COMMENT attribute \"Area size exception (inside RZ_AoI / outside UA Urban centre)\", see Figure 8.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8: MMU exception at RZ border\n\n\nExceptions to this rule will be made\n\nIf the size of an object is &lt; MMU is due to a geometrical peculiarity of the AoI (i.e., the object is constrained between RZ AoI and/or UA Urban centre boundaries).\nIn individual cases where features of network-forming classes (roads, railways, rivers), ≥ 0,01 ha and &lt;0,2 ha, are mapped, to provide connectivity outside the AoI.\n\nObjects located within the AoI of the riparian zone:\n\nLinear features (roads, railways, rivers) that are split into two or more polygons by other linear elements (e.g. the road/railway network) will be mapped, even if the resulting segments are smaller than the MMU, to preserve the network. However, features &lt;0,1 ha will be generalised, see Figure 9.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 9: MMU exception of linear elements\n\n\n\nObjects inside Urban Atlas urban centres keep their MMU of 0,25 ha and will not be generalised.\nUrban objects which are confined by roads, railways, or rivers. Features &lt;0,25 ha will be generalised.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 10: MMU exception between roads\n\n\nIn addition, there are some MMU exceptions in relation to change mapping; these are presented in the chapter Change mapping.\nMMW Exceptions:\n\nTo maintain continuity of linear features (CODE classes 1.2.1.0, 1.2.2.0, 6.2.1.0, 6.2.2.0, 8.1.1.0 and 8.1.2.0); the MMW may fall below the limit of 10 m, over a distance of up to 100 m.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 11: MMW exception\n\n\nGood Practice for Data Display – Mapping Scale\nOn-screen mapping scale is 1:5.000 – 1:10.000 depending on the landscape and feature class. Large homogeneous objects like agricultural areas or woodland are mapped at scales 1:8.000 – 1:10.000. For all other features, 1:5.000 mapping scale is applied.\nOverlap Rules\nObjects may not overlap. In case of real objects overlay, the following rules apply:\n\nIf objects overlap on different levels, the top level is mapped. Example: if an artificial canal overlaps a river, the canal is mapped continuously.\nIf objects overlap on the same level, the visually dominant object is mapped continuously. However, if roads and railways meet on the same level, railways are mapped continuously to maintain the railway network.\n\nPriority Rules\nThe priority rules applied are defined as follows:\n\nObjects &lt;0,5 ha are added to the neighbouring object with the next lesser number of the same sub-class.\nObjects &lt;0,5 ha are added to the neighbouring object of the same upper class.\nObjects &lt;0,5 ha are added to the neighbouring object with the longest common border line. Exception: Objects surrounded by railways or roads. If an object is below the MMU size and is completely surrounded by a road or railway network, it shall be aggregated with that surrounding traffic line. However, an exception is made for urban objects. Please see respective definition with Class 1.x.x.x.\n\nApplication of Additional Data Sources\nFor data interpretation, additional data sources like CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2006/2012/2018, Urban Atlas (UA) 2012/2018, topographic maps, national Web Map Service (WMS) services, Commercial Off-the-Shelf (COTS) navigation data and auxiliary data including local expertise is used.\n\nUA2012/2018: UA2012/2018 data are integrated in the RZ data set, where UA urban centres3 are located inside the RZ. In that case, the MMU of all UA objects is kept; however the UA class codes are recoded to RZ CODE values (as far as possible). Outside UA Urban centres, UA data are used as an important data source for class delineation and class interpretation. Thus, interpreting the same areas twice is avoided and data compatibility between UA and RZ is guaranteed.\nHigh-Resolution Layer (HRL) Imperviousness Degree (IM.D.): HRL Imperviousness Degree is used to support the imperviousness degree derivation of urban classes during the first mapping phase for the reference year 2012. IM.D. is determined by either visual interpretation based on EO data and the Imperviousness Degree layer or derived by an automatic routine based on the IM.D. layer and road segments.\nHRL Tree Cover Density (TCD): For the reference year 2012, HR Forest Layer is applied to support TCD classification. The classification is performed by either visual interpretation based on EO data and HR Forest Layer or derived by an automatic routine based on HR Forest Layer and forest segments.\nCLC2012/2018: CLC2012/2018 is used as important data source for class assignment. CLC data use ensures data compatibility between CLC and RZ.\nLandsat-8/Sentinel-2 data sets: For critical classes, Landsat-8/ Sentinel 2 data are used as additional data source. They are primarily used to support cropland/grassland differentiations and to detect irrigated areas, as in those cases, mono-temporal data analysis will not provide reliable results. Time series of summer images are collected for irrigated areas and images acquired in late summer/autumn/spring are used for grassland identification.\nIn-situ data: Diverse national in-situ data like WMS services, specific maps or classifications as well as descriptions and maps of Natura 2000 (N2000) or RAMSAR site are used to support the object interpretation.\n\nStandard Comments\nIn order to clarify certain mapping delineations, there are some comments defined as product attributes. The following Table 9 lists the allowed entries for the product attributes [COMMENT_12] and [COMMENT_18]. In case of multiple comments, these must be separated by a semicolon followed by space character (“…; …”).\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nList of standard comments\n\n\n\n\n\n\nDescription; Note\nComment\nUA\n\n\nExternal Border:\nPolygons &lt;0,5 ha at AoI boundary or Urban Atlas Urban centre (polygons have shared line segment(s) with RZ_AoI boundary or UA Urban centre).\nOnly polygons outside UA Urban centres are considered.\n\"Area size exception (at RZ_AoI / UA Urban centre boundary)\"\n\n\n\nInternal Border:\nPolygons &lt;0,5 ha inside RZ_AoI (for communicated exceptions only).\nOnly polygons outside UA Urban centres are considered.\n\"Area size exception (inside RZ_AoI / outside UA Urban centre)\"\n\n\n\nUrban Atlas:\nUA2012 or UA2018 data inside UA Urban centre\n\n“UA2012”\n“UA2018”\n\n\nUrban Atlas:\nUA2012 data inside UA2012 Urban centre.\nException for UA2012 data captured in updated UA2012 Urban centre limits (not identical to URAU_2012_RG.shp).\n\"UA2012_core_regions_update (name of update source)\"\n“UA2012”\n\n\nUrban Atlas:\nGap within the UA region. The gap IS NOT in contact with the regular RZ mapping and is to be filled with mapped data in UA code range.\n“Adjusted data of UA Urban centre”\n“NoData”\n\n\nChange Mapping:\nChanges over several classes. Each change is &lt;0,5 ha but overall change (=sum of individual change areas) is ≥0,5 ha.\n“Splitted change”*\n\n\n\nChange Mapping:\nPolygons &lt;0,5 ha with no change but connected to change polygons (same code at a neighbouring polygon in one of the two years)\n“Areas related to change”\n\n\n\nDifferent water levels in comparison of image data taken during dry/wet season and “normal” water level. The water level of the “normal” situation should be used for delineation.\nonly Polygons outside UA Urban centres are considered\n\"Different water levels\"\n\n\n\nFor areas completely or partially flooded by water (flooded land), only Polygons outside UA Urban centres are considered.\n\"Flooded area\"\n\n\n\n\n* See section below for in-depth explanation\nTable 9: List of Standard Comments\nChange mapping\nFollowing definitions and rules for Land Cover Change (LCC) mapping are based on the LCC rules of CORINE Land Cover (CLC) change detection methodology [35]. The given rules were adopted and expanded to the Natura 2000 [36] specifications and requirements and are now implemented for the Riparian Zone change mapping. Therefore, the change mapping of the RZ dataset is fully aligned with the CLMS N2K dataset4.\nMapping of Land Cover Change in Riparian Zones project\nFor the Riparian Zones, change mapping is carried out by visual interpretation of 2012 LC/LU vector data and satellite imagery of the timeframe 2012 and 2018 and subsequent direct delineation of change polygons. The final vector data file contains the complete LC/LU status for both timeframes (status layers) and the changes (change layer).\nAlthough the basis of identification of changes is the interpretation of detectable land cover differences on satellite images from 2012 and 2018, the support of ancillary data has proved being very useful.\nNot every change visible on the images is a real LC/LU change, e.g.:\n\ntransient phenomena such as floods and temporary waterlogging\nseasonal changes in natural vegetation\nseasonal changes in agriculture, such as effects of crop rotation on arable land\ncrop areas burned related to harvesting/seeding\nforest plantation growth, still not reaching the height and/or canopy closure of forest\nchanges of water level\ntemporal changes in water cover of fishpond cassettes being part of their management\nseasonal changes of snow spots in high mountains.\n…\n\nThe introduction of false changes is avoided. As an example, highly non-probable changes are (non-exhaustive list):\n\n1.1.1 → 2.-8.x.x: urban areas seldom disappear\n5.1.x → 3.1.1 bushy vegetation of different climatic zones do not change to each other\n8.1.2 → X.X.X highly modified natural water courses and canals do not change to another class\netc.\n\nPlausibility checks are performed to detect unlikely or impossible changes.\nThe Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) for LCC is set to 0,5 ha.\nThe Minimum Mapping Width (MMW) for the LCC polygons is 10 m.\nExceptions from the MMU, where a generalisation of change objects &lt;0,5 ha is not reasonable because it would discard valuable information, can occur. Where polygons &lt;0,5 ha have been generalised, an MMU exception COMMENT attribute is added (see Table 9.\nLand Cover Changes (LCC) are defined as changes that occur between 2012 (acquisition dates 2011–2014) and 2018 (+/-1 years). LCCs resulting from different interpretations of the same subject are not considered as a change.\nThere are two types of changes.\n\nSimple Change\nComplex Change\n\nSimple Changes\nSimple changes are defined as where either a single polygon changes from one LC/LU class to another, or a new polygon ≥0,5 ha emerges within an existing, larger polygon (see Figure 12).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: A Green urban area (1.4.0.0) ≥0,5 ha in 2012 changes into Continuous urban fabric (1.1.1.1) in 2018\n\n\nSimple changes at RZ AoI border (MMU exception)\nLand Cover Changes (LCC) which are split by the border of a RZ AoI and have a total area (inside and outside of the RZ AoI) of ≥0,5 ha will be mapped, even if the area inside the RZ AoI is smaller than the MMU.\nThe MMU of these border polygons is 0,05 ha. Objects &lt;0,05 ha will be generalised.\nThe COMMENT attribute for these changes is “area size exception”, see Table 9, (necessary for topological checks).\nComplex Changes\nComplex changes are defined as changes where more than two types of Land Cover polygons are involved. An example can be given by three different types of LC/LU, where two of the types fully or partially change into a third type. Some examples of complex changes are explained in the following sub-sections.\nSingle change class: complex change consisting of different LC/LU classes, but mapped as single change class\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Changes (Continuous urban fabric 0,4 ha, water area 0,15 ha) with an area &lt;0,5 ha and different classes make up a complex change area of 0,55 ha\n\n\nIn 2018, 0,4 ha of Managed grassland (4.1.0.0) has changed into Continuous urban fabric (1.1.1.1) and 0,15 ha has changed into a small water surface. Thus, for 2018, there are two classes with individual areas &lt;0,5 ha which together are &gt;0,5 ha, while in 2012 there was only one class. These areas are combined to a complex change area of &gt;0,5 ha by integrating the small water area into the Continuous urban fabric change (1.1.1.1).\nThis is a complex change without the COMMENT attribute “Splitted change” as the small water surface polygon is generalised to capture the overall change of Managed grassland into Continuous urban fabric.\nDisappearing polygons: complex change results in disappearing polygons\nAn existing 2012 object (2.2.2.0) changes into two or more different objects (2.2.1.0 and 1.1.2.0) where each new area is below the MMU, see Figure 14. Because the areas of change are &lt;0,5 ha and located in areas with different LC/LU, the new objects will, because of generalization and priority rules, be incorporated into their respective existing surrounding object.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: An Olive grove (2.2.2.0) changed into Vineyards, fruit trees and berry plantations (2.2.1.0) and Industrial, commercial and military units (1.1.2.0), but because the areas are &lt;0,5 ha, they are merged with the neighbouring objects.\n\n\nThe Olive grove (2.2.2.0) in 2012 completely changed into Industrial, commercial and military units (1.1.2.0) and Vineyards, fruit trees and berry plantations (2.2.1.0). Both changes are &lt;0,5 ha. Therefore, in 2018, the industry patch is merged to Continuous urban fabric (1.1.1.1) and the fruit tree patch is merged to Semi-natural grassland (4.2.1.0).\nMMU exceptions: Complex change mapping\nSplitted change: Complex changes &lt; MMU\nIndividual change areas will be mapped as a complex change polygon even if they are &lt;0,5 ha (MMU), if their total combined area is ≥0,5 ha, see Figure 15. The minimum mapping unit for single polygons of complex changes is 0,05 ha. Objects &lt;0,05 ha will be generalised.\nFor topological reasons this type of complex change is given the COMMENT attribute “Splitted change” , see Table 9.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Urban expansion: Several changes with an area &lt;0,5 ha make up a complex change area of 0,5 ha (0,1 ha of 4.1.0.0 and 0,4 ha of 2.1.1.0 changed to 0,5 ha of 1.1.1.1)\n\n\nAreas related to change\nOne other MMU exception beside the “splitted change” has been introduced for the change mapping, with the COMMENT attribute: “areas related to change”, see Figure 16. This COMMENT attribute is applied when an area is partially changed. In this case, if the remaining unchanged area is &lt;MMU, it will not change even though there is a change in the surrounding.\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Polygons &lt;0,5 ha with no change (4.1.0.0) but connected to polygons (1.3.1) where there is a change\n\n\nIn 2012, a Managed grassland area (4.1.0.0) partially changed into a Mineral extraction […] site (1.3.1) in 2018. The unchanged grassland area is smaller than the MMU, i.e. &lt;0,5 ha. In this case the unchanged grassland area is given the attribute “Areas related to change” in the comment field. Only features with the same code in both years get this comment.\nHandling changes in, by definition, heterogeneous classes - changes at landscape level\nRZ nomenclature includes some land cover classes that, by definition, represent heterogeneous landscapes. These certain polygons are made up of a mosaic of smaller homogenous patches, especially following land cover classes:\n\n2.3.2 Complex cultivation patterns\n2.3.3 Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation\n3.3.x Mixed Forest\n\nIf individual land cover changes occur within polygons of these classes in a way that they altogether change the characteristics of the area, then possibly other classes must be delineated. As a result the original heterogeneous landscape class might disappear or be still present but in a smaller extent.\nHandling changes in, by definition, change classes - changes at landscape level\nRZ nomenclature includes some land cover classes that, by definition, are characterized by a land cover change. These classes are:\n\n1.3.1.0 Mineral extraction, dump and construction sites\n1.3.2.0 Land without current use\n3.4.0.0 Transitional woodland and scrub\n3.6.0.0 Damaged Forest\n6.3.2.0 Burnt areas (except burnt forest)\n\nPlausibility checks should be applied after change mapping production.\nIf a construction site in 2012 is visible, a new construction, mainly urban, is likely to be visible in 2018 as well. If a construction site in 2018 is visible, another former land use, is likely to be visible in 2012.\nTransitional woodland indicates that a regrowth of forest should appear from 2012 to 2018 or deforestation between 2012 and 2018 (exception: slow growing afforestation areas such as cold or dry regions in northern and central Europe). Some theoretic examples can be seen here below:\nPolygon ≥0,5 ha increases or decreases with a change ≥0,5 ha resulting in a polygon ≥0,5 ha.\nBeing the most frequently occurring change type, changes ≥0,5 ha connected to an existing polygon are always mapped (see Figure 17 and Figure 18).\nIncrease from 2012 to 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Simple change\n\n\nUrban fabric (predominantly public and private units) (1.1.1) increases with an area ≥0,5 ha in 2018 by occupying Natural & semi-natural grassland (4.2.x) from 2012.\nDecrease from 2012 to 2018\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Simple change\n\n\nThe area of an Olive grove (2.2.2) decreases in 2018. The remaining area of the 2.2.2 polygon is still ≥0,5 ha in 2018, and thus still mapped in the Riparian Zones product.\nSpecial case: change &lt;0,5 ha integrated into neighbouring change of ≥0,5 ha\nChange objects with an area smaller than the MMU can be integrated into an adjacent change with an area of ≥0,5 ha.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 19: Small change integrated into adjacent change\n\n\nAn Urban fabric area (1.1.1) in 2012 changed into a 0,8 ha construction site (1.3.1) and 0,3 ha water surface (8.x.x) in 2018. The area of the water surface is below the MMU for changes and is therefore not mapped in the Riparian Zones product. Instead the water surface area is integrated into the change area of the construction site which has an area large enough for being mapped as a change.\nIn this case, in 2018, there are two classes mapped in the Riparian Zones product (1.1.1 and 1.3.1) and in 2012 one class (1.1.1). The &lt;0,5 ha 8.x.x polygon is generalised to capture the change but no COMMENT attribute “Splitted change” in the comment field is necessary.\nDisappearing polygon: a polygon decreases to &lt;0,5 ha with a change ≥0,5 ha\nIf the size of a polygon decreases to below 0,5 ha due to a change of an area ≥0,5 ha, it will disappear in the 2018 interpretation because of generalisation (see Figure 20).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Generalisation (disappearing polygon)\n\n\n0,3 ha of a polygon of 0,7 ha Green urban area (1.4) in 2012 changed into Urban fabric (1.1.1) in 2018. The 0,4 ha area of the remaining Green urban area is then below the MMU. Consequently, this remaining part is generalised into Urban fabric (1.1.1) in 2018.\nNew polygon: a polygon grows to ≥0,5 ha with a change ≥0,5 ha\nThe evolution of a feature that existed in 2012 but was then ≤0,5 ha (and thus not mapped), to an area ≥0,5 ha in 2018. An increase with ≥0,5 ha must be mapped in 2018 (see Figure 21).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 21: A new Aquaculture pond (8.2.3) is established on semi-natural grassland (4.2.x).\n\n\nSpecial case: A new established feature with “splitted change”\nA new feature ≥0,5 ha (or a feature that existed in 2012, but used to be ≤0,5 ha, thus, not mapped) which grows with a change ≥0,5 ha must be mapped.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 22: New established feature with splitted change\n\n\nIn 2012 there is an industrial area (1.1.2) that is below the MMU. Part of a neighbouring urban area (1.1.1) &gt;0,5 ha changes into industrial area in 2018. The small industrial area from 2012 together with the new industrial area now has a total area large enough for mapping (&gt;MMU) and therefore the small industrial area “changes” along with the current change and forms a complex change area."

    "section": "4.1 Use case: Grassland LC/LU changes and trends analysis in Natura 2000 sites",
    "text": "4.1 Use case: Grassland LC/LU changes and trends analysis in Natura 2000 sites\nEstablished under the EU Habitats and Birds Directives, Natura 2000 is the world's largest ecological network of protected areas, a network of key breeding and resting places for rare and endangered species. In addition to the focus on species, the network also aims at protecting more than 200 different Natural habitat types. The network covers about 18% of the EU's land area throughout all 27 EU Member States. It is not a system of strict nature reserves from which all human activities would be excluded. While it includes strictly protected areas, most of the land remains privately owned and managed. EU Member States must ensure that the sites are managed in a sustainable manner to prevent significant impacts on species and habitats for which the sites have been designated. It is part of the policy strategy to conserve Europe's biodiversity and was established on the legal requirements of the Habitats Directive and the Birds Directive.\nGrassland ecosystems are highly biodiverse and species-rich vegetation types, providing a range of ecosystem services. The selection of Natura 2000 sites mapped was prioritized on the basis of occurrence of 32 different grassland habitat types across Europe, as defined by Annex I of the Habitats Directive (Council Directive 92/43/EEC).\nBased on a comparative assessment of the N2K product, reference years 2006, 2012 and 2018, LC/LU changes and trends were analysed within the selected Natura 2000 sites and their two km buffer zone.\nDue to the known strong decrease of grassland habitats, the focus of the analysis relied especially on semi-Natural and Natural grasslands, as they are vulnerable to different pressures such as intensification of agriculture and grassland management, land abandonment, shrub encroachment, afforestation, urbanisation and several more.\nThe assessment was based on the mapping of land cover/land use as well as changes between the three reference years 2006, 2012 and 2018 of the selected Natura 2000 sites, including a 2 km buffer zone around each site, to form the total N2K product coverage of around 631.820 km² across Europe.\nThe assessment of the Grassland Habitat Types concentrated on the grassland areas and its changes. LC/LU changes are associated with the following Land Cover Change Groups (LCGs), defined in close cooperation with representatives from DG ENV and EEA:\n\nUrbanisation\nDe-urbanisation\nAgricultural intensification\nAgricultural extensification\nAgricultural conversion to managed grassland\nAgricultural conversion to cropland\nAgricultural abandonment\nForest increase - Natural succession\nForest increase – Plantation\nTree encroachment\nDeforestation\nForest degradation\nRegeneration\nIntensification of grassland use\nExtensification of grassland use\nDecline of woody plants\nWoody plant encroachment\nShift of tree line\nColonization by marginal grasses\nExpansion of grassland\nGrassland degradation\nScrub encroachment\nScrub retreat\nSedimentation / Plant succession\nDrainage\nDeconstruction and reNaturation\nHydrological restoration\n\nThe mapped area covers a substantial part of the Natura 2000 sites and the European territory and includes, to different degrees, all MS and most Biogeographical Regions. Some biogeographical zones and MS are better represented than others and therefore the analysis should be read in the context of this representativeness.\nThe figure below (Distribution of Level 1 classes in the mapped N2K AoI (Natura 2000 sites and buffer zone) for the reference years 2006, 2012 and 2018.) gives an overview of the eight Level 1 classes, their area coverage and N2K AoI proportion for the three-time steps 2006, 2012 and 2018. The highest share is taken up by Woodland and forests, followed by Cropland and Grassland. Wetlands are by far the rarest class, followed by Water and Open spaces with little or no vegetation.\n\nA look at the changes between the time steps 2006 – 2012 and 2012 – 2018 shown in the figure below (Overview total gains and losses per Level 1 class in ha and % for the periods 2006-2012 and 2012-2018 on European Level) reveals high dynamics in the classes Urban and Grassland, both in total numbers and percentage share. The observation period 2006 – 2012 indicates a considerable high increase of Urban areas (2,64%) whereas Grasslands decreased to a similar total area but a lesser percentage. A percentual high loss was also experienced by Wetlands and Heathland and moorlands.\nThe period 2012 – 2018 is dominated by the high decrease of the Grassland class, with even 0,21 percentage points more than the previous period, and a high increase of Urban area, even though to a lesser extent than in 2006 – 2012.\nComparing the two periods of observation, the decrease of Cropland between 2006 and 2012 is compensated by an increase in the following six years. Both classes, Urban and Grassland, continued their trend in opposite directions. Heathland and moorlands as well as Wetlands continue to loose area, even if to a slower ratio than in the subsequent period. The Open spaces with little or no vegetation class has experienced a reverse trend from an area gain between 2006-2012 to area loss in 2012-2018. One reason behind this may be the recovery of landscape after fire events. The figure also shows the declining area of No Data areas which reached zero in 2018. Since this cannot be considered a real change but is only resulting from a significant improvement in satellite data availability, it appears without bar in the graph.\n\nThe figure below shows the most important pressures on grassland habitats for the 2012 – 2018 period. This helps to better understand the changes in the mapped area. The percentage of each pressure is related to the total area of changes.\nThe most prominent pressures are ‘Agricultural intensification’ (16%), Tree encroachment (16%) and ‘Agricultural conversion to cropland’ (14%) and followed by ‘Urbanization’ (13%). ‘Expansion of grassland’ (9%) remains the most important change process related to a grassland gain."

    "text": "4.2 Measuring the effectiveness of EU Member States efforts for protecting Natura 2000 grasslands\nIn addition to the previous general assessment, Copernicus Land Monitoring Service is helping to support and measure the effectiveness of EU Member States and their efforts for protecting the increasingly important Natura 2000 grasslands.\nWhen looking at the LC/LU inside the Natura 2000 sites, as compared to the 2 km buffer surrounding the sites, and as expected, the more anthropogenic land uses, such as urban and cropland, cover larger areas in the buffer zones as shown in the table below. In contrast, Natural and semi-Natural land cover is more abundant inside the sites. Grasslands are found to an almost equal extent in both areas because the class includes not only Natural and semi-Natural (species-rich) but also intensely managed (species-poor) grasslands, which are more comparable in their use to croplands.\nOverall, a continuous loss of grasslands can be observed, and the trend is visible both in the buffer zone and the sites themselves, even though it is to a lesser amount in the latter.\n\nOther key findings (shown in the table below) include:\n\nGrasslands showed a decline for two of the four different classes distinguished in the mapping. Managed grassland (class 4100) and Semi-Natural grassland with woody plants (class 4212) have the highest losses.\nAlpine areas (4220) as the only type being more or less stable.\nSemi-Natural grassland without woody plants (4211) experienced a gain for both reference periods.\n\n\nLooking at the data for Natura 2000 sites and buffer zones separately (Figure below), the grassland classes inside the Natura 2000 network can be seen to still be declining in area, apart from class 4211, which experienced slight gains in both periods, the reason for this most likely being land abandonment leading to shrub encroachment. In the buffer zone, classes 4100, 4212 and 4220 all decline more severely than inside the sites. The graph clearly shows once again that grassland cover seems overall to be subject to bigger changes outside Natura 2000 sites (i.e. in the buffer).\n\n\nThe N2K product allows us to recognise that good work is being done within Natura 2000 areas to lessen the decline of grasslands areas. However, it also tells us more work is required to protect these valuable areas, in particular with the continual monitoring of changing agricultural practices.\nThe Copernicus Land Monitoring Service (implemented by the European Environment Agency) is committed to the continual improvement of such monitoring schemes to address these challenges collectively. In particular, it is hoped that grasslands can not only be effectively preserved with N2K, but that the monitoring and assessment of biodiversity in line with the objectives of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 2030 can also be achieved to the highest level. All of which will help ensure the continual protection of the vitally important Natura 2000 grasslands."

    "text": "5.3 Representativity analysis\nThe final selection of Natura 2000 sites depended to a large extent also on the satellite data availability for 2006 and 2012 in order to avoid data gaps as much as possible. That led to the fact that the mapped Natura 2000 sites are neither equally distributed across Europe nor equally representative of the Member States or the Biogeographical regions: the distribution of the selected sites with a high representation are in South, South-western, Central and Eastern Europe whereas the Nordic countries and the British and Irish Isles are underrepresented.\nMoreover, a considerable number of sites without designated grassland habitats and which were therefore not specifically selected for the mapping, still overlap with, or lie completely within the LC/LU mapping boundary (the designated AoI) that is defined by the outline of the selected N2K sites plus a 2 km buffer.\nThe boundaries of Member States with coastlines were extended 10km to the sea in order to assure full coverage of all the Natura 2000 sites chosen for the mapping. The additional area of coastal waters is included in every MS with marine area.\nIn a first assessment step, the number of sites per MS which are completely covered by the mapping area was compared to the total number of Natura 2000 sites of each MS.\nThe mapping area (Natura 2000 sites and buffer) includes sites which are completely covered, as well as some which are only partly covered by the N2K AoI. The number of completely mapped Natura 2000 sites was determined by the N2K LC/LU mapping boundaries. The intention is to show to what degree the Natura 2000 sites with designated grassland habitats of every MS are represented in the CLMS N2K mapping products.\nSome sites, however, where not counted as completely mapped, if the GIS operation identified parts of non-coverage. This is often the case along the coastline, where the sea area has been cut out of the N2K AoI even though the Natura 2000 boundary actually extends a bit further into the open water. Further, the area mapped in every MS (Natura 2000 sites + buffer) is compared and put into relation with the calculated area, which may also include a 10km buffer of coastal waters, if applicable.\nThe first part of the assessment indicates a considerable high representation of Natura 2000 sites (disregarding their designated habitat types) for Hungary (44,38%), Italy (38,04%) and Bulgaria (37,46%) and very low representation of Finland (0,32%), United Kingdom (0,96%) and Ireland (0,99%), with an EU average of 17,17%.\nWhen comparing the area of each MS national territory with the mapped area, Slovenia (42,19%) and Luxembourg (37,76%) as very small countries are at the top of the list but closely followed by large MS like Bulgaria (37,46%) and Spain (31,41%). Again, Finland (0,18%), the United Kingdom (0,33%) and Ireland (0,86%) are only covered to a fraction compared to the EU average of 13,52% (Table 2).\n\nTable 2: Representativeness of CLMS N2K mapping for all Natura 2000 site types within each MS\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember state (MS)\nNatura 2000 sites (total)\nNatura 2000 sites completely mapped\nShare of mapped sites\nTotal area mapped (km²)\nArea MS (km²)\n% of MS area\n\n\n\n\nAustria\n350\n53\n15.14%\n8295.83\n83927.63\n9.88%\n\n\nBelgium\n310\n51\n16.45%\n6152.43\n31349.53\n19.63%\n\n\nBulgaria\n339\n127\n37.46%\n40686.90\n113948.15\n35.71%\n\n\nCroatia\n779\n157\n20.15%\n13312.80\n75603.23\n17.61%\n\n\nCyprus\n63\n3\n4.76%\n440.94\n15931.60\n2.77%\n\n\nCzech Republic\n1153\n160\n13.88%\n8587.88\n78869.90\n10.89%\n\n\nDenmark\n384\n20\n5.21%\n2750.28\n71628.43\n3.84%\n\n\nEstonia\n567\n120\n21.16%\n12385.10\n62545.91\n19.80%\n\n\nFinland\n1859\n6\n0.32%\n683.41\n384010.79\n0.18%\n\n\nFrance\n1779\n394\n22.15%\n63840.30\n585899.90\n10.90%\n\n\nGermany\n5200\n767\n14.75%\n47540.00\n372524.70\n12.76%\n\n\nGreece\n446\n34\n7.62%\n12010.60\n236245.66\n5.08%\n\n\nHungary\n525\n233\n44.38%\n26189.30\n94022.25\n27.85%\n\n\nIreland\n604\n6\n0.99%\n786.51\n91139.82\n0.86%\n\n\nItaly\n2613\n994\n38.04%\n78436.60\n365392.96\n21.47%\n\n\nLatvia\n333\n29\n8.71%\n3418.80\n73070.45\n4.68%\n\n\nLithuania\n559\n61\n10.91%\n2565.31\n72943.46\n3.52%\n\n\nLuxembourg\n66\n20\n30.30%\n980.15\n2595.77\n37.76%\n\n\nMalta\n52\n3\n5.77%\n114.79\n1717.87\n6.68%\n\n\nNetherlands\n196\n9\n4.59%\n1918.43\n44292.10\n4.33%\n\n\nPoland\n984\n242\n24.59%\n45526.40\n326678.13\n13.94%\n\n\nPortugal\n166\n22\n13.25%\n10444.80\n113707.07\n9.19%\n\n\nRomania\n606\n105\n17.33%\n38392.70\n249883.33\n15.36%\n\n\nSlovakia\n683\n161\n23.57%\n9635.40\n49665.16\n19.40%\n\n\nSlovenia\n355\n80\n22.54%\n8637.47\n20473.70\n42.19%\n\n\nSpain\n1863\n569\n30.54%\n174763.00\n556466.17\n31.41%\n\n\nSweden\n4087\n352\n8.61%\n9476.23\n495428.75\n1.91%\n\n\nSwitzerland\n37\n3\n8.11%\n938.88\n41280.13\n2.27%\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n935\n9\n0.96%\n1078.16\n326416.02\n0.33%\n\n\nTOTAL\n27893\n4790\n17.17%\n629989.41\n5037658.58\n13.52%*\n\n\n\n²MS size is overestimated due to the sea buffer calculation. Since the Eastern European countries, which are not member of the EEA 39, are not included in the layer, the neighbouring countries were treated as sea and buffered with 10km into the neighbouring country.\n*Average taken from all MS. The percentage of comparing the sum of all calculated MS areas with the total mapped area would be roughly 8%.\nThe focus of the CLMS N2K mapping was put on sites with grassland habitats. These are considered as especially rich in biodiversity and face a declining trend in most parts of the Member States. Table 3 below gives an overview of the number of sites which contain at least one declared type of grassland type (according to the Natura 2000 Standard Data Forms) and its coverage by the LC/LU mapping.\nThe assessment of the representativeness of sites with grassland habitats produces a high number for Slovenia (71,64%), Croatia (57,97%) and Bulgaria (56,50%). A low representativeness of grassland habitats is found in Finland (1,85%), the United Kingdom (3,93%) and Ireland (6,76%). In some MS, also a considerable high number of sites with grassland habitats is partly mapped and, in some MS, the percentage of these sites which are not mapped at all is comparably high, e.g. Austria, Cyprus, Denmark, Sweden and the Netherlands. Note that this table includes all sites which were listed in the year 2018 and the number of grassland sites may have been lower when the sites were chosen for the 2006-2012 mapping.\nGrassland sites:\n\nTable 3: Representativeness of Natura 2000 sites with grassland habitat types per MS.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nMember State\nTotal\nNot Mapped\nPartly Mapped\nCompletely Mapped\n% of Completely Mapped Sites\n\n\n\n\nAustria\n199\n141\n19\n39\n19,60%\n\n\nBelgium\n263\n139\n75\n49\n18,63%\n\n\nBulgaria\n177\n28\n49\n100\n56,50%\n\n\nCroatia\n138\n41\n17\n80\n57,97%\n\n\nCyprus\n27\n24\n0\n3\n11,11%\n\n\nCzech Republic\n303\n161\n38\n104\n34,32%\n\n\nDenmark\n175\n132\n29\n14\n8,00%\n\n\nEstonia\n243\n85\n54\n104\n42,80%\n\n\nFinland\n271\n256\n10\n5\n1,85%\n\n\nFrance\n1103\n557\n219\n327\n29,65%\n\n\nGermany\n3001\n1761\n602\n638\n21,26%\n\n\nGreece\n120\n72\n20\n28\n23,33%\n\n\nHungary\n410\n110\n76\n224\n54,63%\n\n\nIreland\n74\n68\n1\n5\n6,76%\n\n\nItaly\n1932\n638\n343\n951\n49,22%\n\n\nLatvia\n130\n99\n7\n24\n18,46%\n\n\nLithuania\n179\n112\n15\n52\n29,05%\n\n\nLuxembourg\n48\n16\n14\n18\n37,50%\n\n\nMalta\n5\n1\n4\n0\n0,00%²\n\n\nNetherlands\n100\n79\n14\n7\n7,00%\n\n\nPoland\n522\n237\n74\n211\n40,42%\n\n\nPortugal\n83\n49\n12\n22\n26,51%\n\n\nRomania\n197\n77\n44\n76\n38,58%\n\n\nSlovakia\n437\n219\n84\n134\n30,66%\n\n\nSlovenia\n67\n7\n12\n48\n71,64%\n\n\nSpain\n1152\n346\n316\n490\n42,53%\n\n\nSweden\n1480\n1101\n79\n300\n20,27%\n\n\nSwitzerland\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\nn/a\n\n\nUnited Kingdom\n178\n165\n6\n7\n3,93%\n\n\nTOTAL\n13014\n6721\n2233\n4060\n31,20%\n\n\n\n² Four sites were chosen for LC/LU mapping but due to spatial query settings, those were registered as “partly mapped”. Manual checks produced a coverage of 4 out of the 5 grasslands sites, resulting in an 80% grassland site coverage.\nSwitzerland as non-EU state is listed in the table because of three Emerald sites there located which are included in the N2K product however it was not included in the representativeness assessment. The Emerald network have some similarities to Natura 2000 network but do not follow exactly the same criteria.\nThe low numbers of some MS in the two sections of the representativeness assessment are seen as an important indicator for how the results related to these MS can be assessed. In these cases, a projection of the results which derived from a small number of sites, may not represent the situation on the national level.\nIn conclusion, the mapped Natura 2000 sites are neither equally distributed across Europe nor equally representative of the MS or the Biogeographical regions. The distribution of the selected sites with a high representation are in South, South-western, Central and Eastern Europe whereas the Nordic countries and the British and Irish Isles are underrepresented."

    "text": "5.4 Natura 2000 boundary changes and the impact in the CLMS N2K product Area of Interest (AoI)\nThe AoI for mapping the LC/LU was setup, changed and extended throughout the evolution of the CLMS N2K product, in three different phases:\nFirst, during the initial setup of the N2K AoI under the GIO project phase (GMES Initial Operation Phase in 2014) a selection of Natura 2000 grassland-rich sites (representing five grassland habitats types, namely, 6210, 6240, 6250, 6510 and 6520) as identified in Annex I of the Habitats Directive was used;\nA list of Natura 2000 sites was proposed by EC DG ENV on the basis of their representativeness and relative importance for the given habitat types. The information for selecting sites on the basis of the above criteria has been taken from the Natura 2000 sites’ Standard Data Forms in the most recent version of the EU-wide Natura 2000 database at the time;\nBased on this list of Natura 2000 site codes the corresponding site boundaries were extracted from the Natura 2000 Database (version: Natura 2000 v2013). This led to an AOI area of around 150.800 km²;\nA GIS- and EO data analysis was then performed to:\n\nBuffer the Natura 2000 sites by 2km, which increased the N2K AOI area to around 252.600 km²)\nIdentify existing VHR satellite coverage for the reference years 2006 +/- 1 year (with extension to +/- 2 years for gap-filling) and 2012 +/- 2 years within defined seasonal windows, so that in combination they reach &gt; 80% coverage of the full (buffered) N2000 site size (i.e. in the same areas, for both time steps). This reduced the AOI to around 162.600 km² - 173.800 km²\n\nThe finally mapped N2K product during the GIO Phase covered 160.443 km².\nIn the second production phase (started in 2016) the N2K AOI was enlarged. Additional Natura 2000 sites were selected, now based on a list of 32 different Annex 1 grassland habitat types as defined under the Habitats Directive. The additional Natura 2000 site boundaries were again taken from the Natura 2000 Database (this time from version: end2015). The buffer was applied to the newly selected sites and minor adaptations to the N2K AoI were made to correct imprecisions and omission errors. This changed the AoI size and geometry in a way that:\n\nMissing 2km buffers were included, for mainly buffers around islands were missing\nWrongly clipped buffers of selected N2K sites were included\nExisting gaps between N2K sites shapefile and EEA39 member states boundary shapefile were filled. Regarding water areas, those gaps over water appeared if EEA39 boundaries do not coincide with N2K site boundaries along coastlines and had also to be corrected and included\nMinor gaps and spikes between the AoIs of the first and second phases were corrected and included\nSmall angles (&lt;20°) were checked and corrected where feasible.\n\nIn the end of the second production phase, the existing 160.443km² were complemented by 471.377 km² leading to the N2K product covering 631.820 km² for the reference years 2006 and 2012.\nIn the third production phase (started in 2020 and finished in May 2021) the N2K product is updated to the reference year 2018, including the change layer 2012-2018. No changes were applied to the geographic coverage of the product.\nThe option taken for the N2K product was to have a stable AoI so that the change mapping exercise could be done within the same area and that the derived statistics were not affected by changing AoI’s.\nAs can be seen from the above “history” of the N2K AoI creation process, there were several input data sets used as well as several geospatial corrections applied to generate the currently used N2K coverage of 631.820km². As stated above there are several factors which prevent a 1:1 relation between the N2K AoI and Natura 2000 site boundaries:\n\nDifferent Natura 2000 database versions were applied to generate the unbuffered N2K site selection (version Natura 2000 v2013 and later version end2015). Changes in the yearly updated Natura 2000 site definitions were not adapted for already mapped N2K sites (Figure 4)\nN2K AoI adaptations to achieve a technically “clean” dataset may have led to deviations from a strict 2km buffer zone around each selected Natura 2000 site.\nThe availability of archived VHR satellite data for the reference years 2006 and 2012 required a threshold to produce N2K LC/LU information also for Natura 2000 sites covered by up to a minimum of 80% satellite data.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4: Example of diverging Natura 2000 site boundaries (red 2015 version, blue 2019 version, grey N2K product coverage incl. the 2km buffer)\n\n\nAlso, due to the buffering of the Natura 2000 sites by 2km, the N2K sites may actually cover more than one Natura 2000 site (Figure 5). This has been one the reasons for the removal of the Natura 2000 Site code from the N2K AoI, to avoid a misinterpretation of the data. Because within the same N2K polygon there could be reference to more than one Natura 2000 site.\n\n\n\nFigure 5 - Example of N2K AoI (red) covering multiple N2K sites (black)\n\n\nTo quantify the effects of the changing Natura 2000 Database on the N2K products a spatial analysis of the Natura 2000 database changes between 2015 and 2018 was performed.\nDuring the data preparation it became evident, that the Natura 2000 databases are more complex than expected. The Natura 2000 sites are very often defined as “multi-part” polygons (Figure 6). This means that multiple detached areas form together one Natura 2000 site. Due to the above described N2K AoI creation process, Natura 2000 sites are not always covered by the N2K product for all their single areas. This is an important fact, if N2K products are related to Standard Data Form (SDF) information, e.g. Habitat coverage within site, which relates to the complete Natura 2000 site.\nFor this all Natura 2000 sites affected by the full N2K AoI were selected from the 2015 Natura 2000 Database (version: end2015). This resulted in 3872 different site codes. Performing the same process to the 2018 Natura 2000 Database (version: end2018) led to 3868 site codes. Four site codes have changed between 2015 and 2018. Here the Natura 2000 sites had a newer release data. This was for example the case for the Danish site code DK00BX044 in 2015, which was split up into two new site codes DK00BB396 and DK00BB380 (Figure 7). The four changed site codes were also included in the spatial analysis of the 2018 data.\nOther Natura 2000 DB changes led to a partial coverage of 2018 geometries of formerly fully covered in 2015 (Figure 8). Partially these changes might still be covered by the N2K AoI, but initially the original 2km buffer around the site is no longer valid for the complete site (Figure 9).\n\n\n\nFigure 6 - Example of multi-part Natura 2000 site (AT3210001) only partially covered by N2K AOI\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7 - Example of changed site codes and geometries from 2015 (top) to 2018 (bottom) Natura 2000 DB version\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 8 - Example of Natura 2000 DB site changes from 2015 (top) to 2018 (bottom).

Background N2K AOI\n\n\nThe Natura 2000 site boundaries were intersected with the N2K AoI for both years to analyse the total area covered by the Natura 2000 sites, and their spatial overlap with the N2K AoI. Due to the fact that there are overlapping geometries in the Natura 2000 sites DB (Figure 10), the analysis was performed also with the Natura 2000 sites merged to one analysis extent.\nThe results showed that more than 98% of the area covered by the selected grassland-rich Natura 2000 sites is covered by the N2K product in for both Natura 2000 site definitions, version end2015 and end2018 (Figure 5).\n\n\n\nFigure 10 - Example of Natura 2000 DB site overlap.

Of this newly added area, 66% was still covered by the unchanged N2K AOI (Figure 6).\n\nTable 5 - Area changes for Natura 2000 DB sites from 2015 to 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNatura 2000 area changes 2015-2018\n\nValue\n\n\n\n\nCommon area in 2015 and 2018\n\n271.946,91 km²\n\n\nArea only in 2015 data (removed)\n\n537,04 km²\n\n\nArea only in 2018 data (new)\n\n1320,02 km²\n\n\n\ncovered by N2K AOI (Inside)\n871,79 km² (66 %)\n\n\n\nnot covered by N2K AOI (Outside)\n448,23 km² (44 %)\n\n\n\nThe boundaries of Natura 2000 may change from year to year but usually those are not dramatic changes and are usually covered by the 2km buffer zone. There are however a few occasions when a change in extent may have gone over the N2K established AoI. Extreme situation illustrated below (Figure 11)\n\n\n\nFigure 11 – Example of a Natura 2000 site change in extent (enlargement): the green buffer follows the shape of the site in 2012, but in the 2018 Natura 2000 database the site has been enlarged therefore not anymore totally covered by the N2K AoI\n\n\nThis was one of the reasons why it was decided to remove the Natura 2000 site boundary from the N2K product: to allow users to use the N2K LC/LU product in combination with the Natura 2000 latest boundary, if they wish so in their dedicated assessments therefore not being bound by an outdated outline that may change on a yearly basis."

    "text": "6.2 Interpretation and Classification\nThe Interpretation and Classification procedures follow the mapping rules and principles as stated in the CLMS N2K Nomenclature and Mapping Guideline (AD01). This documentation refers specifically to object delineation; MMU and MMW; feature extraction priority rules; water level mapping rules; handling of geometric inconsistencies between the reference years; inclusion of additional data sources and the application of standardized data attributes. Feature delineation is applied at a 1:5.000 mapping scale.\nMapping LC/LU Status\nThe LC/LU status is mapped through a visual interpretation and object delineation using the above specified VHR data as primary data source. The type of LC/LU is classified according to the CLMS N2K Nomenclature and Mapping Guideline document (AD01). A minimum mapping unit (MMU) of ≥ 0.5 ha for all objects applies. A minimum width (MMW) of ≥ 10 m is defined. MMU exceptions are allowed for:\n\nObjects located at a CLMS N2K product border: If an object is cut at a border, the feature is mapped, if the whole object (inside and outside the border) would amount to ≥ 0.5 ha. However, the MMU of those divided features lying inside the site shall have a MMU of at least ≥ 0.1 ha. Smaller objects will be generalized.\nComplex changes (see changes examples below).\nLinear features (roads, railways, rivers) that are split in two or more polygons by other linear elements (e.g. the road/railway network) will be mapped even if the resulting segments are smaller than the MMU in order to preserve the network. However, features &lt; 0.1 ha will be generalized.\nUrban objects which are confined by roads or railways. Features &lt; 0.25 ha will be generalized.\n\nMMW exceptions are allowed:\n\nTo maintain continuity of features with mostly linear nature (Codes 1.2.1, 1.2.2, 6.2.1, 6.2.2, 8.1.1 and 8.1.2), the MMW may fall below the limit of 10 m over a distance of up to 100 m.\n\nMapping LC/LU Changes\nLand Cover Changes (LCC) are changes that occur between the different reference timespans 2006 (+/- 2 years), 2012 (+/- 2 years) and the timespan 2018 (+/- 1 year). Differences resulting from different interpretations of the same subject are not considered as change. A change is mapped if it covers over a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of &gt;0.5ha. The mapping is carried out by visual interpretation and comparison of two subsequent reference years (2006-2012, 2012-2018) and their corresponding LC/LU vector data and satellite imagery. Changed areas are directly delineated. In CLMS N2K changes are provided as separate vector products (2006-2012 and 2012-2018).\nPossible prone to change areas are, for example:\n\nConstruction sites;\nAbandoned land/grassland/cropland near urban areas;\nDamaged forest indicates that a regrowth of forest should appear;\nTransitional woodland indicates that a regrowth of forest should appear.\n\nInterpreters must be aware that not every change visible on the images should be treated as changes, e.g.:\n\ntransient phenomena such as floods and temporary water-logging;\nseasonal changes in Natural vegetation;\nseasonal changes in agriculture, such as effects of crop rotation on arable land;\nforest plantation growth, still not reaching the height and/or canopy closure of forest;\nseasonal changes of water level;\ntemporal changes in water cover of fishpond cassettes being part of their management;\nseasonal changes of snow spots in high mountains.\n\nThe introduction of false changes must also be avoided. Many of these can and should be excluded by pure logics. These vary from country to country (e.g. while normally sea water do not change into pasture, it might happen in the Netherlands), thus following examples are not exhaustive and not binding for all cases. However, in most cases they can be considered valid.\nHighly non-probable changes are for example:\n\nUrban areas to non-urban classes (1.1.1 🡺 2.-8.x.x): urban areas seldomly disappear\nConversion of a highly modified water course (e.g. canal) to a new class (8.1.2 🡺 X.X.X)\n\nBeing the most frequently occurring change type, changes &gt; 0.5 ha connected to an existing CLMS N2K polygon are always mapped. In the following example scheme an existing urban site has been enlarged by more than 0.5ha between the reference year t0 (1.1.1) and the reference year t+1.\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Simple change mapping\n\n\nAlthough the MMU for change mapping is 0.5 ha, in some cases single changes &lt; 0.5 ha are also mapped together. When a polygon, existing for the reference year t0, is split at the later t1 reference into several other areas (e.g. a road construction, urban growth, …), the individually connected change parts can be mapped together, if they make up a ≥ 0.5 ha complex change polygon. Resulting polygons in the database &lt;0.5ha receive the COMMENT attribute “Area size exception (inside Natura2000 AoI boundary)” (see chapter Technical specification and AD01).\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Complex change mapping. Individual changes with each MMU &lt; 0.5 ha make up a change area of 0.5 ha.\n\n\n“Splitted” changes can also lead to change polygons &lt;0.5ha. In the example scheme below, an existing industrial site exists in the image t0, but is not mapped in the CLMS N2K product for t0, because it is below the MMU (&lt;0.5ha). The site has enlarged between t0 and t+1 and now forms together an area &gt;0.5ha. The small industrial area from t0 “changes” now as well and forms together with the actual change a complex change area. The formerly too small area receives the COMMENT “Splitted change”.\n\n\n\nFigure 17: New established feature with splitted change.\n\n\nExceptions for a polygon &lt;0.5 ha are also allowed for unchanged areas in relation to a change situation. In the following example, an existing road in t0 is relocated. Previous road sections change to an urban class (1.1.1) and previous urban area changes to new road (1.2.1) in t+1. A small road section (&lt;0.5 ha) remains as road over the years and does not change. It gets the comment “Areas related to change” in the CLMS N2K product.\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Area related to change within road relocation."

    "text": "7.1 Internal thematic validation\nFor each CLMS N2K product a thematic validation was performed by the service providers (internal thematic validation). The assessment is based on a scientifically and statistically sound stratification and sampling scheme, tailored to assessing the thematic accuracy of the N2K LC/LU status and change layers.\nDuring the production phase of the 2018 update the following accuracies applied to these products:\n\nCLMS N2K LC/LU status map 2012 and 2018: ≥ 85 % overall accuracy and ≥ 80 % for class-specific user’s and producer’s accuracies\nCLMS N2K LC/LU change map 2012-2018: ≥ 85 % overall accuracy and ≥ 80 % for class-specific user’s and producer’s accuracies\n\nThe 2012 and 2006 products have been validated after the production phase by an independent service provider (see AD 02).\nSampling Design and Stratification\nThe thematic accuracy assessment for the CLMS N2K is based on a stratified random point sampling scheme, in which all areas have a known non-zero probability of sampling. To assess overall and class-specific accuracies, stratifications are conducted on the LC/LU code level 4 (status layer), as well as on omission and commission strata (change layer).\nResponse Design\nAll sample points were re-interpreted at Code level 4 during the validation. This step was performed as a visual interpretation by independent, well-trained operators, who were not involved in the production itself, using the applicable Very High-Resolution (VHR) satellite data defined in the production. When re-interpreting the LC/LU sample points, the response design had to respect the latest product specifications and N2K nomenclature guidelines.\nValidation results\nTo keep full statistical rigor and representativeness, and account for unequal inclusion probabilities and the relative occurrence of classes, area related weights were applied according to the area ratio for each class compared to the overall area. To deal with very imbalanced and skewed ratios between changed and unchanged areas at class level 1, an area restriction was implemented to reduce the area weight of polygons &gt; 100ha.\nThe results of the internal validation proved the sufficient thematic quality of CLMS N2K products, as can be seen in the following tables.\nFull details on the class specific user and producer accuracy results can be found in the ANNEX of this document.\n\nTable 11: LC/LU internal 1accuracy assessment - unweighted results per product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThematic accuracy [%]\nConfidence* Interval\nNo. of assessed sample points\n\n\n\n\nLC/LU 2012 overall unweighted accuracy\n96.52 %\n0.20 %\n30 203\n\n\nLC/LU 2018 overall unweighted accuracy\n96.22 %\n0.21 %\n30 203\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLC/LU change 2012-2018 overall unweighted accuracy for level 4\n97.85 %\n0.16 %\n29 088\n\n\nLC/LU change 2012-2018 overall unweighted accuracy for level 1\n98.61 %\n0.13 %\n29 088\n\n\n\n\n*at a 95% confidence level\n\n\nTable 12: LC/LU internal2 accuracy assessment - weighted results per product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThematic accuracy [%]\nConfidence* Interval\nNo. of assessed sample points\n\n\n\n\nLC/LU 2012 overall weighted accuracy\n96.80 %\n0.21 %\n30 203\n\n\nLC/LU 2018 overall weighted accuracy\n96.67 %\n0.21 %\n30 203\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nLC/LU change 2012-2018 overall weighted accuracy for level 4\n98.64 %\n0.12 %\n29 088\n\n\nLC/LU change 2012-2018 overall weighted accuracy for level 1\n99.33 %\n0.08 %\n29 088\n\n\n\n\n*at a 95% confidence level\n\n\nTable 13: Unweighted User’s and Producer’s Accuracies for the Change Layer 2012 – 2018\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser’s Accuracy\nProducer’s Accuracy\n\n\n\n\nCode Level 1\nNon-Change\nCI [%]\nChange\nCI [%]\nNon-Change\nCI [%]\nChange\nCI [%]\n\n\nClass 1\n99.56\n0.21\n95.47\n1.29\n98.78\n0.34\n98.34\n0.80\n\n\nClass 2\n99.66\n0.20\n96.57\n1.10\n98.89\n0.35\n98.93\n0.63\n\n\nClass 3\n99.95\n0.06\n94.95\n1.33\n98.82\n0.31\n99.80\n0.28\n\n\nClass 4\n100.00\n0.00\n92.94\n1.37\n94.56\n1.00\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 5\n100.00\n0.00\n96.30\n1.20\n97.83\n0.69\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 6\n99.41\n0.32\n95.11\n1.50\n98.24\n0.53\n98.31\n0.90\n\n\nClass 7\n100.00\n0.00\n93.76\n2.28\n98.12\n0.67\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 8\n99.68\n0.18\n96.64\n1.53\n99.53\n0.21\n97.73\n1.25\n\n\n\n\nTable 14: Area-weighted User’s and Producer’s Accuracies for the Change Layer 2012 – 2018 with area-restriction applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser’s Accuracy\nProducer’s Accuracy\n\n\n\n\nCode Level 1\nNon-Change\nCI [%]\nChange\nCI [%]\nNon-Change\nCI [%]\nChange\nCI [%]\n\n\nClass 1\n99.56\n0.21\n95.47\n1.29\n99.72\n0.08\n93.07\n3.15\n\n\nClass 2\n99.66\n0.20\n96.57\n1.10\n99.63\n0.12\n96.82\n1.82\n\n\nClass 3\n99.95\n0.06\n94.95\n1.33\n99.31\n0.18\n99.65\n0.48\n\n\nClass 4\n100.00\n0.00\n92.94\n1.37\n98.18\n0.35\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 5\n100.00\n0.00\n96.30\n1.20\n99.78\n0.07\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 6\n99.41\n0.32\n95.11\n1.50\n99.61\n0.12\n92.72\n3.66\n\n\nClass 7\n100.00\n0.00\n93.76\n2.28\n99.68\n0.12\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 8\n99.68\n0.18\n96.64\n1.53\n99.91\n0.04\n89.19\n5.45\n\n\n\n\nTable 15: Area-weighted User’s and Producer’s Accuracies for the Change Layer 2012 – 2018 without area-restriction applied\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUser’s Accuracy\nProducer’s Accuracy\n\n\n\n\nCode Level 1\nNon-Change\nCI [%]\nChange\nCI [%]\nNon-Change\nCI [%]\nChange\nCI [%]\n\n\nClass 1\n99.56\n0.21\n95.47\n1.29\n99.95\n0.01\n80.47\n10.18\n\n\nClass 2\n99.66\n0.20\n96.57\n1.10\n99.98\n0.01\n62.30\n13.86\n\n\nClass 3\n99.95\n0.06\n94.95\n1.33\n99.93\n0.02\n96.70\n4.43\n\n\nClass 4\n100.00\n0.00\n92.94\n1.37\n99.94\n0.01\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 5\n100.00\n0.00\n96.30\n1.20\n99.95\n0.02\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 6\n99.41\n0.32\n95.11\n1.50\n99.93\n0.02\n78.89\n11.62\n\n\nClass 7\n100.00\n0.00\n93.76\n2.28\n99.97\n0.01\n100.00\n0.00\n\n\nClass 8\n99.68\n0.18\n96.64\n1.53\n99.99\n0.01\n53.48\n14.06"

The date of in-situ data should coincide as much as possible with the acquisition date of satellite images used to derive the N2K product. In-situ data used in the validation should be independent, i.e. must not have been used in compilation of the N2K databases.

A time series plot is associated with each point.\n\n\nThe EGMS Basic product provides InSAR displacement data provided in the satellite line-of-sight, with annotated geolocalisation and quality measures per measurement point (MP). Satellite line-of-sight means that measurements are projected along the imaginary line which connects the satellite to the target, and which have to be reprojected to assume the meaning of vertical/horizontal displacement.\nThe product is provided as a 2D map of InSAR measurement points, colour-coded by average velocity. A time series plot is associated with each point.\nSignificantly, Basic products are spatially referenced to a virtual reference point, whose time series is derived by a statistical analysis of the dataset. As a consequence, the provided measurements are meaningful just considering the processed area. It is not possible to compare deformations from adjacent areas belonging to different products of the same level. The time series are temporally referenced to the value of the deformation model at time T0=0. Please refer to [RD1] for a description of the selected approaches’ rationale.\nProduction of the EGMS Basic product is a necessary first step and input to the more advanced EGMS Calibrated product. EGMS Basic products are provided as two discrete datasets; one made from the SAR data acquired orthogonal to the satellite ascending trajectory (south to north), the other from data acquired orthogonal to the descending trajectory (north to south). Please refer to documents [RD1] and [RD2] for additional details on ascending and descending acquisitions."

    "text": "2.2 The EGMS Calibrated product\nThe EGMS Calibrated product is considered the main EGMS product as it serves the needs of most users. It is fundamentally the same as the Basic product but enhanced by the InSAR MP displacement values being referenced to model derived from GNSS time-series data, thereby making the InSAR measurements absolute (with reference to an Earth centred reference frame). Calibrated products, containing absolute measurements, overcome the intrinsic limits of the Basic ones, being possible to compare deformations from adjacent areas belonging to different products of the same level.\nAs with Basic products, the Calibrated product is provided as two discrete datasets, one in ascending geometry, the other in descending geometry.\nSome isolated islands may not have GNSS data available. For these areas, Calibrated products are produced by harmonizing Basic products with respect to each other, and then adjusting the mean ground velocity to zero. Measurements of any displacements on such islands are not referenced against the GNSS-derived datum, but a local InSAR MP."

    "text": "2.3 The EGMS Ortho product\n\n\n\nFigure 2 EGMS Ortho product. Absolute, vertical displacement. The gridded nature of the data is clearly visible.\n\n\nThe EGMS Ortho product exploits the discrete look-angles provided by the Calibrated product to derive two further layers; one of purely vertical displacements, the other of purely east-west displacements. Both layers are resampled to a 100 m grid to coincide with other Copernicus products. Vertical and east-west displacement components can be estimated taking advantage of the prior information coming from GNSS data. Refer to RD1 for more details about the Ortho products generation process.\nThe main benefit of Ortho products is ease of understanding to those new to InSAR as the data-acquisition geometry need not be considered. However, such decomposed data can still prove valuable even to InSAR experts when considering phenomena that might include non-vertical displacements such as those relating to tectonics or landslides.\nIn the following, some characteristics of the EGMS Ortho product:\n\nCoverage: To make the Ortho product, both ascending and descending geometry Calibrated products are needed. In some areas of high topographic relief, the usual geometric artefacts associated with radar remote sensing (layover, foreshortening and shadow) prevent 100% coverage. In such areas, there are no EGMS Ortho measurements.\nNot full-3D: Each Sentinel-1 satellite is near-polar-orbiting with a side-looking radar. The ‘range-finding’ echoes of the SAR instrument consequently become less sensitive as the direction of any ground displacement approaches that of the satellite flightpath, i.e., north-south. Importantly, any ground movements in these directions will not be measured directly by InSAR but reintroduced from the GNSS data (please refer to RD1). In fact, north-south displacement components are not available for any MP, since they are estimated from GNSS data, characterized by a much lower spatial resolution than InSAR measurements. Therefore, vertical, and east-west components are estimated thanks to a spatial interpolation of the information available. This approach, however, does not introduce a significant bias in the measurements, apart from area affected by strong spatial variations of north-south displacements.\nSpatial sampling: The ascending and descending Calibrated products that make the Ortho product have different acquisition geometries, meaning that the distribution of MPs is not identical between the two datasets. To ensure that both datasets represent the same area of ground, the data is averaged to a common 100 m grid, this particular spacing chosen to coincide with other Copernicus services and it is a good compromise between resolution and spatial coverage of the database.\nTemporal sampling: in general, the temporal sampling of the satellite tracks contributing to the Ortho product is not aligned. This happens because L2b products, from which L3 are derived, exhibit acquisition patterns shifted in times on a track basis. Moreover, there may be holes in the datasets (e.g., missed acquisition, especially in 2015). In order to define a common temporal grid, for the baseline all time-series will start on January 2016 and end on December 2021, with regular six-day temporal sampling with origin on 3-April-2014 (launch date of S1A). A regular sampling will be maintained whenever possible, even if, in correspondence of huge gaps in the L2b products time series used to generate the L3 level, customized solutions may be adopted. Please refer to document RD1 for further details on L3 products generation."

The augmented EPND (A-EPND) model is produced based on GNSS data from various sources, with the EUREF Densification product (EPND) as the main source. In order to exploit the strengths of both InSAR and GNSS data, the reference model contains average velocities in 3D (east, north, up) on a 50-km grid. Deviations from the constant velocity model, as well as motion on shorter spatial scales than the reference model, will be estimated from InSAR data with high spatial density. Further details about the A-EPND model can be found in RD8."

This means that even if data for a given burst are available just in a subset of the 5 years range (e.g., nominal years from 2018 to 2022, years in which data are available from 2019 to 2021), still the deliverables for that burst will be named after the nominal years (2018 and 2022).\nIt may happen that one or more deliverables are not uploaded on the platform/archive at the moment in which one update of the service is released to the public. In case a deliverable is added after the release to the public of the service, it will be added with the version number (z) starting from 1.\nThe suffix added to the file names won’t take part in the generation of the PID for the measurement points contained in the file itself.\nData which will substitute corrupted/wrong one in the EGMS system will have a name following the convention, even if the substituted data won’t be maintained in the archive.\n\nSome examples\nSecond update (data between 1st January 2018 and 31st December 2022)\nEGMS_L2a_088_0282_IW2_VV_2018_2022_1.zip\nEGMS_L2b_088_0282_IW2_VV_2018_2022_1.zip\nEGMS_L3_E40N28_100km_E_2018_2022_1.zip\nSecond update (a burst with acquisitions just between 8th July 2018 and 29th October 2021)\nEGMS_L2a_076_0391_IW1_VV_2018_2022_1.zip\nA correction to the burst belonging to the second update (in case an error is spot in the data)\nEGMS_L2a_088_0282_IW2_VV_2018_2022_2.zip"

    "text": "This document describes the theoretical and practical bases for EGMS production. The document recalls the main aspects from basic SAR interferometric theory to the specifics of EGMS product generation. These include the Basic (L2a), Calibrated (L2b) and Ortho (L3) InSAR products, plus the model for the positioning satellite framework used for the calibration of the latter two.\nThis section continues with a list of associated EGMS references that may be of use to the reader, followed by a glossary of terms that are used throughout the document. Section three describes the basics of SAR interferometry and section four the features of a generic multi-interferogram processing chain. Section five discusses the differences between a generic processor and the four processing chains used for EGMS production. Sectionssix, seven and eight describe production of the three EGMS products, followed by a final section covering product updates.\nIt should be noted that, despite the contribution of four independent InSAR processing chains for generating the deliverables, EGMS results are characterized by a very high level of consistency and homogeneity. In fact, before starting any production activity, all processing chains have been carefully tuned to meet all project requirements and provide similar products, independently of the actual processing algorithms adopted by the different operators. The availability of different processing chains has allowed the providers, during the Operational Readiness Review phase, to run internal cross-check procedures which have improved the final quality of the measurements.\n\n\n\nTable 1 Reference Documents\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nID\nReference or Related Document\nDate\nID\nSource or Link/Location\n\n\n\n\nRD1.\nEEA.DIS.R0.20.011_Annex I_Tender Specifications\n09/01/2020\nEEA/DIS/R0/20/011_Annex_I\nContractual document\n\n\nRD2.\nProduct User Manual\n10/05/2022\nEGMS-D4-PUM-SC1-2.0-007\nEGMS Original Consortium\n\n\nRD3.\nProduct Description and Format Specification\n14/03/2022\nEGMS-D6-PDD-SC1-2.0-009\nEGMS Original Consortium\n\n\nRD4.\nProduct Archive and Dissemination System Description\n20/12/2021\nEGMS-D9-DAS-SC1-2.0-011\nEGMS Original Consortium\n\n\nRD5.\nQuality assurance and control report\n06/02/2023\nEGMS-D10.5-QCR-SC2-064\nEGMS Original Consortium\n\n\nRD6.\nUser Uptake Plan\n15/10/2021\nEGMS-D14-UUP-SC1-8.0-016\nEGMS Original Consortium\n\n\nRD7.\nEnd User Requirements\n20/12/2021\nEGMS-D15-URD-SC1-8.0-017\nEGMS Original Consortium\n\n\nRD8.\nGNSS calibration report\n20/12/2021\nEGMS-D19.2-GCR-SC1-3.0-031\nEGMS Original Consortium\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTable 2 List of acronyms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAcronym\nMeaning\n\n\n\n\nAOI\nArea Of Interest\n\n\nAPS\nAtmospheric Phase Screen\n\n\nCLC\nCORINE Land Cover\n\n\nCORINE\nCoordination of Information on the Environment\n\n\nCPU\nCentral Processing Unit\n\n\nCRS\nCoordinate Reference System\n\n\nDEM\nDigital Elevation Model\n\n\nDInSAR\nDifferential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar\n\n\nDS\nDistributed Scatterer\n\n\nECMWF\nEuropean Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts\n\n\nEEA\nEuropean Environment Agency\n\n\nEGMS\nEuropean Ground Motion System\n\n\nEPN\nEUREF Permanent Network\n\n\nEPND\nEUREF Permanent Network Densification\n\n\nERA5\nFifth Generation ECMWF Atmospheric Reanalysis\n\n\nESD\nEnhanced Spectral Diversity\n\n\nETRF2000\nEuropean Terrestrial Reference Frame 2000\n\n\nETRS89\nEuropean Terrestrial Reference System 1989\n\n\nEUDV\nEuropean Dense Velocities\n\n\nEUREF\nReference Frame Sub-Commission for Europe\n\n\nGNSS\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System\n\n\nGRD\nGround Range Detected\n\n\nHH, VV, HV, VH\nHorizontal-Horizontal, Vertical-Vertical, Horizontal-Vertical, Vertical-Horizontal\n\n\nInSAR\nInterferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar\n\n\nIPE\nInSAR Processing Entity\n\n\nIRF\nImpulse Response Function\n\n\nIW\nInterferometric Wide Swath\n\n\nLAEA\nLambert Azimuthal Equal Area projection\n\n\nLOS\nLine Of Sight\n\n\nMODIS\nModerate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer\n\n\nMP\nMeasurement Point\n\n\nNGL\nNevada Geodetic Laboratory\n\n\nNWM\nNumerical Weather Model\n\n\nPDGS\nPayload Data Ground Segment\n\n\nPOD\nPrecise Orbit Determination\n\n\nPRF\nPulse Repetition Frequency\n\n\nPS\nPersistent Scatterer\n\n\nPSC\nPersistent Scatterer Candidate\n\n\nPSI\nPersistent Scatterer Interferometry\n\n\nRADAR\nRadio Detection And Ranging\n\n\nRMSE\nRoot Mean Square Error\n\n\nSAR\nSynthetic Aperture Radar\n\n\nSBAS\nSmall BAseline Subset\n\n\nSCE\nSnow Cover Extent\n\n\nSCR\nSignal to Clutter Ratio\n\n\nSLC\nSingle Look Complex\n\n\nSNR\nSignal to Noise Ratio\n\n\nTOPS\nTerrain Observation with Progressive Scan\n\n\nUSGS\nUnited States Geological Survey\n\n\nWAP\nWide Area Processing\n\n\nWGS84\nWorld Geodetic System 1984\n\n\n\nTable 3 Glossary of terms\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTerm\nExplanation\n\n\n\n\nAmplitude\nMeasure of the strength of a radar signal (units of voltage), related to the amount of electromagnetic energy backscattered towards the radar by a target. In a coherent SAR system, the radar return is a complex signal, including – for each image pixel -both magnitude (amplitude) and phase.\n\n\nAscending (& descending) geometry\nTerms relating to the direction of the near-polar orbiting satellite travel during a particular image acquisition. Two distinct geometries of SAR data are acquired when the satellite is flying from north to south as opposed to south to north. These two geometries of InSAR measurements are available in the EGMS Basic (L2a) and Calibrated (L2b) products as two discrete datasets. In the EGMS Ortho (L3) product, they are combined to constrain measurements to either purely vertical or east-west ground displacements (again, in two discrete datasets).\n\n\nAzimuth (angle of satellite flight)\nThe flight direction of the satellite. Normally orthogonal to the SAR instrument’s look direction (range direction).\n\n\nAzimuth resolution\nAzimuth resolution describes the ability of an imaging radar to separate two closely spaced scatterers in the direction parallel to the motion of the sensor. It is inversely proportional to antenna length, and so a long (e.g. 1 km) antenna is synthesised by imaging the same points on the ground multiple times as the satellite proceeds along its orbital path – hence synthetic aperture radar.\n\n\nBurst\nTo allow for large swaths imaged by the radar sensor while orbiting the Earth, Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide swath (IW) Single Look Complex (SLC) products are made up of three sub-swaths that are in turn made up of separate ‘bursts’ by cyclically switching the antenna beam between multiple adjacent sub-swaths.\n\n\nCoherence\nCoherence is a measure of the correlation between corresponding pixels in an interferometric pair; ranging from 0, where there is no useful information, to 1,where there is no noise in the interferogram (the two images are locally identical, but a constant phase shift). In InSAR, coherence serves as a measure of quality, and is adversely affected by e.g., excessive variations in the acquisition geometry or changing/moving elementary scattering centres within each resolution cell.\n\n\n(Coordinate) Reference System\nA coordinate-based system used to locate geographical entities and involving a specific map projection in relation to a specific Earth ellipsoid. In EGMS, in agreement with previous EEA studies, the coordinate reference system (CRS) is ETRS89-LAEA Europe, also known in the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset under the identifier: EPSG:3035. The Geodetic Datum is the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (EPSG:6258). The Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection is centred at 10°E, 52°N. Coordinates are based on a false Easting of 4321000 meters, and a false Northing of 3210000 meters. the WGS84 reference is used that is based on the European Terrestrial Reference System 89 (ETRS89), and its version the European Terrestrial Reference Frame 2000 (ETRF2000).\n\n\nDifferential interferogram\nThe result of compensating a SAR interferogram for fringes induced by changes in the acquisition geometry yet leaving any net phase due to target motion or propagation effects.\n\n\nDisplacement resolution\nThe minimum amount of displacement (in millimetres) that can be reliably measured by the system between two SAR acquisitions.\n\n\nDistributed scatterer\nObjects that individually do not show strong amplitude, nor high phase coherenceyet, when combined, their spatial and electromagnetic homogeneity allows spatial averaging to increase their SNR. It is a situation which can be found in areas where the backscattered signal from a single SAR resolution cell consists of a larger number of small scatterers, without the presence of a single dominant scatterer (e.g., land cover classes without significant vegetation, rocky areas, desert areas not covered with sand).\n\n\nEpoch\nThe time of the acquisition of each radar image used in a multi-temporal InSAR analysis. The initial EGMS release covers epochs from 2015 up to Dec 2020. The first image used in the analysis can vary depending on the specific area of interest.\n\n\n(SAR) Focusing\nData processing step that improves the resolution of the radar image by properlycombining all radar returns scattered from a specific target on ground.\n\n\nFrequency\nThe number of oscillations per unit time. Sentinel-1 operates with a central frequency of 5.405 GHz (corresponding to a wavelength of ~5.55 cm).\n\n\nInterferometry\nA technique using the phase components of two SAR images acquired over the same area of interest from the same acquisition geometry to highlight changes in the phase contributions of each image pixel.\n\n\nGeocoding\nGeographic correction of image data to conform to a map projection. The process of resampling the data to conform to a standard map projection with known co-ordinates.\n\n\nGeo-locational / positional accuracy\nThe “absolute” positional accuracy of an InSAR measurement point. The radar response from the many scattering features within each Sentinel-1 20 m x 5 m ground-cell is integrated into a single response, which is then mapped to the centre of each pixel. Specific algorithms allow one to achieve sub-pixel resolution in the case of strong dominant scatterers.\n\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\nA system of (systems of) orbiting satellites that enable absolute (i.e., relative to anEarth-centred reference system) 3D positioning.\n\n\nLine of sight\nThe direction in which the radar antenna is pointing when transmitting a radar pulse and receiving the return echo.\n\n\nLine-of-Sight (LoS) / SAR incidence angle\nOrbiting SARs are side-looking instruments to enable range measurement. This off-nadir angle is defined as the angle between the vertical and the radar beam at the radar platform. Due to the Earth curvature, the look-angle is not the same as the incidence angle, defined as the angle between the vertical and the radar beam propagation-vector at the Earth’s surface. InSAR displacement measurements are projected in the satellite’s ‘line-of-sight’, an important factor when considering displacements of unknown direction.\n\n\n(InSAR) Measurement point\nA measurement point (MP), in InSAR analyses, is any radar target providing a sufficient level of phase coherence to allow for phase measurements. EGMS InSAR measurement points can emanate from the radar scattering of either a single, high amplitude, dominant scattering centre (a Persistent Scatterer), or from several, contiguous, amalgamated cells (Distributed Scatterer) sharing similar radar returns.\n\n\nMulti-interferogram(techniques)\nThe combination of many interferograms to overcome some of the basic limitations of conventional interferometric techniques based on just two images, e.g.,atmospheric noise, phase unwrapping ambiguities, fast displacements. Multi-interferogram techniques include PSI, SBAS and SqueeSAR®, further explained in the main text.\n\n\nMulti-look imagery\nSAR image where each pixel is obtained by summing the contribution of several pixels of the original, Single-Look Complex (SLC), SAR image. The averaging can involve different SAR images acquired over the same area or it can be the result of a moving average carried out over the image under analysis. In both cases the inherent level of speckle is reduced.\n\n\nNormal baseline\nIn a plane perpendicular to the velocity of the satellite while performing the primary (primary) acquisition and passing through the radar target on ground, it is the (shortest) distance separating the secondary sensor location from the lineconnecting the primary sensor and the target.\n\n\nPhase\nPhase refers to the positional relationship of the peaks and troughs of a sinusoidal (monochromatic) signal. Phase can be measured in radians or degrees. For SAR data, phase values are related to the sensor-to-target distance.\n\n\nPhase unwrapping\nIn SAR interferometry, it is the process of ‘unravelling’ the correct number of 360-degree phase cycles to arrive at a precise estimation of the real displacement of the target (in the line of sight).\n\n\nPoint scatterer\nObjects that behave as pointwise radar targets. Typically, point scatterers exhibit astrong phase stability, persisting throughout nearly all images in a multi-temporal dataset (e.g., urban areas, anthropic activities).\n\n\nPulse\nA short burst of electromagnetic radiation transmitted by the radar. Also described as a group of waves with a distribution confined to a short interval of time. The resolution that may be achieved by a radar sensor in range direction is determined by the bandwidth of the original pulse, rather than its duration, thanks to compression techniques.\n\n\nPulse repetition frequency\nRate of recurrence of the pulses transmitted by a radar, directly affects the resolution in azimuth direction.\n\n\nOrbit state vectors\nOrbit state vectors are used to describe a satellite’s location in its orbit, in space. They are made up of Cartesian vectors of position and velocity which uniquely determine the position and the trajectory of the spacecraft at a specific moment.\n\n\nRange\nRange is the line-of-sight distance between the radar and each illuminated scatterer (target). In SAR usage, the term is applied to the dimension of an image perpendicular to the line of flight of the radar (azimuth).\n\n\nRange resolution\nResolution characteristic of the range dimension (orthogonal to azimuth), usually applied to the image domain, either in the slant range plane or in the ground range plane. Range resolution is fundamentally determined by the system bandwidth.\n\n\nReference frame\nA coordinate-based system used to locate geographical entities and involving a specific Earth model. In EGMS, the coordinate reference system is ETRS89-LAEA Europe.\n\n\nRevisiting time\nThe interval of time in which it is capable to acquire an image of the same area with the same geometric configuration (and hence the same electromagnetic properties). The revisiting time is dependent by the orbits followed by the SAR system, and it may vary from a few days to a few weeks.\n\n\nSignal noise\nAny unwanted or contaminating signal competing with the desired signal (e.g., thermal noise, quantization noise, etc.). The relative amount of additive noise is described by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), equal to the ratio of the power of signal and the power of the noise.\n\n\nSingle Look Complex\nSingle Look Complex (SLC) image data are low-level SAR data where both amplitude and phase are preserved. SLC format SAR data are the basic input for InSAR processing. Contrary to multi-look SAR images, no spatial or temporal averaging or smoothing is performed, and data are provided at the highest resolution compatible with the radar system at hand.\n\n\nSpatial resolution\nThe minimum-size feature that can be discerned by the system. In practice, this is determined by the radar bandwidth in range and the antenna pattern in azimuth. For Sentinel-1 IW swath images, the resolution is ~20 m in azimuth by ~5 m in ground-range, while pixel spacing is ~14 m in azimuth by ~3.5 m in ground range.\n\n\nSpeckle\nA granular interference that inherently exists in any coherent sensor, originatingfrom the coherent sum of the radar returns associated with the elementary scattering centres within a resolution cell.\n\n\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\nA ‘Synthetic Aperture Radar’ is a coherent system that uses the motion of the sensor, in our case an orbiting satellite, to synthesize a large antenna, and thus improve spatial resolution in the flight direction (azimuth) to a useful degree. A SAR system emits pulses of microwave energy and records both the amplitude and phase of the echoed signal, hence recovering information about the target reflectivity and changes in its distance from the sensor (to within integer multiples of the system wavelength).\n\n\nSwath\nThe width of an imaged scene in the range dimension, measured in either ground range or slant range.\n\n\nTemporal baseline\nThe time in days separating the two SAR acquisitions used to make an interferogram.\n\n\nTemporal distribution (of SAR data acquisitions)\nThe total number, and distribution over time, of the SAR acquisitions processed to produce the InSAR result under analysis. A regular and dense distribution of acquisitions is preferred for higher quality results. Note that Sentinel-1 data are nominally acquired every six days over Europe.\n\n\nTemporal resolution / acquisition-rate / sampling\nTemporal resolution relates to the rate at which the Sentinel-1 mission, with two satellites flying 180 degrees apart, re-acquires imagery over the same place. Each satellite acquires repeat data every 12 days, and so together, acquisitions over the same place are made every 6 days.\n\n\nTime series data\nA time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. An InSAR time seriesrelates to a single measurement point and shows the displacement of that point over time according to each SAR image, and with respect to a spatio-temporal reference (InSAR data are relative). The reference in space can be represented by a selected measurement point in the dataset, or by a virtual reference point, whose time series is obtained performing specific statistical analysis on the data. The average velocity of each measurement point can be easily derived from the time series of measurements for each point. Time series data are useful in revealing deviations from the average velocity, e.g., accelerations, and assist in understanding motion trends and evolution."

In a coherent SAR system, the radar return is a complex signal, including – for each image pixel -both magnitude (amplitude) and phase.\n\n\nAscending (& descending) geometry\nTerms relating to the direction of the near-polar orbiting satellite travel during a particular image acquisition. Two distinct geometries of SAR data are acquired when the satellite is flying from north to south as opposed to south to north. These two geometries of InSAR measurements are available in the EGMS Basic (L2a) and Calibrated (L2b) products as two discrete datasets. In the EGMS Ortho (L3) product, they are combined to constrain measurements to either purely vertical or east-west ground displacements (again, in two discrete datasets).\n\n\nAzimuth (angle of satellite flight)\nThe flight direction of the satellite. Normally orthogonal to the SAR instrument’s look direction (range direction).\n\n\nAzimuth resolution\nAzimuth resolution describes the ability of an imaging radar to separate two closely spaced scatterers in the direction parallel to the motion of the sensor. It is inversely proportional to antenna length, and so a long (e.g. 1 km) antenna is synthesised by imaging the same points on the ground multiple times as the satellite proceeds along its orbital path – hence synthetic aperture radar.\n\n\nBurst\nTo allow for large swaths imaged by the radar sensor while orbiting the Earth, Sentinel-1 Interferometric Wide swath (IW) Single Look Complex (SLC) products are made up of three sub-swaths that are in turn made up of separate ‘bursts’ by cyclically switching the antenna beam between multiple adjacent sub-swaths.\n\n\nCoherence\nCoherence is a measure of the correlation between corresponding pixels in an interferometric pair; ranging from 0, where there is no useful information, to 1,where there is no noise in the interferogram (the two images are locally identical, but a constant phase shift). In InSAR, coherence serves as a measure of quality, and is adversely affected by e.g., excessive variations in the acquisition geometry or changing/moving elementary scattering centres within each resolution cell.\n\n\n(Coordinate) Reference System\nA coordinate-based system used to locate geographical entities and involving a specific map projection in relation to a specific Earth ellipsoid. In EGMS, in agreement with previous EEA studies, the coordinate reference system (CRS) is ETRS89-LAEA Europe, also known in the EPSG Geodetic Parameter Dataset under the identifier: EPSG:3035. The Geodetic Datum is the European Terrestrial Reference System 1989 (EPSG:6258). The Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA) projection is centred at 10°E, 52°N. Coordinates are based on a false Easting of 4321000 meters, and a false Northing of 3210000 meters. the WGS84 reference is used that is based on the European Terrestrial Reference System 89 (ETRS89), and its version the European Terrestrial Reference Frame 2000 (ETRF2000).\n\n\nDifferential interferogram\nThe result of compensating a SAR interferogram for fringes induced by changes in the acquisition geometry yet leaving any net phase due to target motion or propagation effects.\n\n\nDisplacement resolution\nThe minimum amount of displacement (in millimetres) that can be reliably measured by the system between two SAR acquisitions.\n\n\nDistributed scatterer\nObjects that individually do not show strong amplitude, nor high phase coherenceyet, when combined, their spatial and electromagnetic homogeneity allows spatial averaging to increase their SNR. It is a situation which can be found in areas where the backscattered signal from a single SAR resolution cell consists of a larger number of small scatterers, without the presence of a single dominant scatterer (e.g., land cover classes without significant vegetation, rocky areas, desert areas not covered with sand).\n\n\nEpoch\nThe time of the acquisition of each radar image used in a multi-temporal InSAR analysis. The initial EGMS release covers epochs from 2015 up to Dec 2020. The first image used in the analysis can vary depending on the specific area of interest.\n\n\n(SAR) Focusing\nData processing step that improves the resolution of the radar image by properlycombining all radar returns scattered from a specific target on ground.\n\n\nFrequency\nThe number of oscillations per unit time. Sentinel-1 operates with a central frequency of 5.405 GHz (corresponding to a wavelength of ~5.55 cm).\n\n\nInterferometry\nA technique using the phase components of two SAR images acquired over the same area of interest from the same acquisition geometry to highlight changes in the phase contributions of each image pixel.\n\n\nGeocoding\nGeographic correction of image data to conform to a map projection. The process of resampling the data to conform to a standard map projection with known co-ordinates.\n\n\nGeo-locational / positional accuracy\nThe “absolute” positional accuracy of an InSAR measurement point. The radar response from the many scattering features within each Sentinel-1 20 m x 5 m ground-cell is integrated into a single response, which is then mapped to the centre of each pixel. Specific algorithms allow one to achieve sub-pixel resolution in the case of strong dominant scatterers.\n\n\nGlobal Navigation Satellite System (GNSS)\nA system of (systems of) orbiting satellites that enable absolute (i.e., relative to anEarth-centred reference system) 3D positioning.\n\n\nLine of sight\nThe direction in which the radar antenna is pointing when transmitting a radar pulse and receiving the return echo.\n\n\nLine-of-Sight (LoS) / SAR incidence angle\nOrbiting SARs are side-looking instruments to enable range measurement. This off-nadir angle is defined as the angle between the vertical and the radar beam at the radar platform. Due to the Earth curvature, the look-angle is not the same as the incidence angle, defined as the angle between the vertical and the radar beam propagation-vector at the Earth’s surface. InSAR displacement measurements are projected in the satellite’s ‘line-of-sight’, an important factor when considering displacements of unknown direction.\n\n\n(InSAR) Measurement point\nA measurement point (MP), in InSAR analyses, is any radar target providing a sufficient level of phase coherence to allow for phase measurements. EGMS InSAR measurement points can emanate from the radar scattering of either a single, high amplitude, dominant scattering centre (a Persistent Scatterer), or from several, contiguous, amalgamated cells (Distributed Scatterer) sharing similar radar returns.\n\n\nMulti-interferogram(techniques)\nThe combination of many interferograms to overcome some of the basic limitations of conventional interferometric techniques based on just two images, e.g.,atmospheric noise, phase unwrapping ambiguities, fast displacements. Multi-interferogram techniques include PSI, SBAS and SqueeSAR®, further explained in the main text.\n\n\nMulti-look imagery\nSAR image where each pixel is obtained by summing the contribution of several pixels of the original, Single-Look Complex (SLC), SAR image. The averaging can involve different SAR images acquired over the same area or it can be the result of a moving average carried out over the image under analysis. In both cases the inherent level of speckle is reduced.\n\n\nNormal baseline\nIn a plane perpendicular to the velocity of the satellite while performing the primary (primary) acquisition and passing through the radar target on ground, it is the (shortest) distance separating the secondary sensor location from the lineconnecting the primary sensor and the target.\n\n\nPhase\nPhase refers to the positional relationship of the peaks and troughs of a sinusoidal (monochromatic) signal. Phase can be measured in radians or degrees. For SAR data, phase values are related to the sensor-to-target distance.\n\n\nPhase unwrapping\nIn SAR interferometry, it is the process of ‘unravelling’ the correct number of 360-degree phase cycles to arrive at a precise estimation of the real displacement of the target (in the line of sight).\n\n\nPoint scatterer\nObjects that behave as pointwise radar targets. Typically, point scatterers exhibit astrong phase stability, persisting throughout nearly all images in a multi-temporal dataset (e.g., urban areas, anthropic activities).\n\n\nPulse\nA short burst of electromagnetic radiation transmitted by the radar. Also described as a group of waves with a distribution confined to a short interval of time. The resolution that may be achieved by a radar sensor in range direction is determined by the bandwidth of the original pulse, rather than its duration, thanks to compression techniques.\n\n\nPulse repetition frequency\nRate of recurrence of the pulses transmitted by a radar, directly affects the resolution in azimuth direction.\n\n\nOrbit state vectors\nOrbit state vectors are used to describe a satellite’s location in its orbit, in space. They are made up of Cartesian vectors of position and velocity which uniquely determine the position and the trajectory of the spacecraft at a specific moment.\n\n\nRange\nRange is the line-of-sight distance between the radar and each illuminated scatterer (target). In SAR usage, the term is applied to the dimension of an image perpendicular to the line of flight of the radar (azimuth).\n\n\nRange resolution\nResolution characteristic of the range dimension (orthogonal to azimuth), usually applied to the image domain, either in the slant range plane or in the ground range plane. Range resolution is fundamentally determined by the system bandwidth.\n\n\nReference frame\nA coordinate-based system used to locate geographical entities and involving a specific Earth model. In EGMS, the coordinate reference system is ETRS89-LAEA Europe.\n\n\nRevisiting time\nThe interval of time in which it is capable to acquire an image of the same area with the same geometric configuration (and hence the same electromagnetic properties). The revisiting time is dependent by the orbits followed by the SAR system, and it may vary from a few days to a few weeks.\n\n\nSignal noise\nAny unwanted or contaminating signal competing with the desired signal (e.g., thermal noise, quantization noise, etc.). The relative amount of additive noise is described by the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), equal to the ratio of the power of signal and the power of the noise.\n\n\nSingle Look Complex\nSingle Look Complex (SLC) image data are low-level SAR data where both amplitude and phase are preserved. SLC format SAR data are the basic input for InSAR processing. Contrary to multi-look SAR images, no spatial or temporal averaging or smoothing is performed, and data are provided at the highest resolution compatible with the radar system at hand.\n\n\nSpatial resolution\nThe minimum-size feature that can be discerned by the system. In practice, this is determined by the radar bandwidth in range and the antenna pattern in azimuth. For Sentinel-1 IW swath images, the resolution is ~20 m in azimuth by ~5 m in ground-range, while pixel spacing is ~14 m in azimuth by ~3.5 m in ground range.\n\n\nSpeckle\nA granular interference that inherently exists in any coherent sensor, originatingfrom the coherent sum of the radar returns associated with the elementary scattering centres within a resolution cell.\n\n\nSynthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)\nA ‘Synthetic Aperture Radar’ is a coherent system that uses the motion of the sensor, in our case an orbiting satellite, to synthesize a large antenna, and thus improve spatial resolution in the flight direction (azimuth) to a useful degree. A SAR system emits pulses of microwave energy and records both the amplitude and phase of the echoed signal, hence recovering information about the target reflectivity and changes in its distance from the sensor (to within integer multiples of the system wavelength).\n\n\nSwath\nThe width of an imaged scene in the range dimension, measured in either ground range or slant range.\n\n\nTemporal baseline\nThe time in days separating the two SAR acquisitions used to make an interferogram.\n\n\nTemporal distribution (of SAR data acquisitions)\nThe total number, and distribution over time, of the SAR acquisitions processed to produce the InSAR result under analysis. A regular and dense distribution of acquisitions is preferred for higher quality results. Note that Sentinel-1 data are nominally acquired every six days over Europe.\n\n\nTemporal resolution / acquisition-rate / sampling\nTemporal resolution relates to the rate at which the Sentinel-1 mission, with two satellites flying 180 degrees apart, re-acquires imagery over the same place. Each satellite acquires repeat data every 12 days, and so together, acquisitions over the same place are made every 6 days.\n\n\nTime series data\nA time series is a series of data points indexed in time order. An InSAR time seriesrelates to a single measurement point and shows the displacement of that point over time according to each SAR image, and with respect to a spatio-temporal reference (InSAR data are relative). The reference in space can be represented by a selected measurement point in the dataset, or by a virtual reference point, whose time series is obtained performing specific statistical analysis on the data. The average velocity of each measurement point can be easily derived from the time series of measurements for each point. Time series data are useful in revealing deviations from the average velocity, e.g., accelerations, and assist in understanding motion trends and evolution."

    "text": "2.1 Amplitude and phase\nIn general, a sensor is ‘coherent’ if it can generate an electromagnetic field exhibiting a fixed (non-random) phase relationship between the field values at different locations and times. If a laser beam could be ‘frozen’ in time, the values of the electric (and magnetic) field would appear regularly arranged in space, approximating a sinusoidal pattern. Although radar systems operate at different frequencies compared to laser devices, they can generate an illuminating beam that can be thought of as a pure sinusoidal wave with known amplitude and phase. Amplitude values are associated with the amount of electromagnetic energy backscattered towards the sensor by any object on ground, while phase values are related to the sensor-totarget distance.\nThe sensor-to-target distance can be expressed as an integer number of wavelengths, plus any fraction of a wavelength remaining, if the distance is not an exact multiple of the wavelength. The phase recorded by the radar signal is either zero (exact integer) or just this fraction of a cycle, ranging from 0 to 2π (phase values, are known modulo-2π). In fact, the two-way travel path of the radar pulse needs to be accounted for, and so the ‘effective wavelength’ of the system is , since the ‘phase signature’ of a point-wise object does not change if its distance from the radar is changed by multiples of ."

    "text": "2.2 Synthetic Aperture Radar\nSatellite sensors are mounted on their platforms with the direction of transmission orthogonal to the flight direction. The inclination of the radar antenna with respect to the nadir (i.e., the direction pointing directly below the sensor) is referred to as the off-nadir, or look, angle (). For most satellite SAR systems available today, the off-nadir angle can be selected among a set of values ranging from about 20 to 50 degrees. It should be noted that, due to the curvature of the Earth’s surface, the incidence angle of the radiation () on flat horizontal terrain is actually larger than the off-nadir angle (Figure 3).\n\n\n\nFigure 3 Geometry of a typical spaceborne SAR system, defining range, ground range and azimuth directions (from Ferretti, 2014).\n\n\nThe direction along the sensor line-of-sight (LoS) is usually called the slant-range (or simply range) direction. The off-nadir angle is never zero, since the radar would receive the echoes from the imaged objects at nearly the same time, making it impossible to create an image.\nThe spatial resolution in azimuth (orthogonal to range) of a radar is directly proportional to the sensor wavelength (λ) and to the distance of the target (), but inversely proportional to the size of the radar antenna (D).\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4 Synthetic Aperture geometric representation.\n\n\nAs an example, a C-band radar satellite (wavelength of about 5 cm) orbiting at 900 Km of height with a 10m antenna would have a 4500 m range resolution. Pretty much useless for any real application. Hence the concept of synthetic aperture. A Synthetic Aperture Radar is a side-looking, imaging radar system that uses the motion of the sensor, in our case an orbiting satellite, to synthesize a much larger aperture, and hence improve azimuth resolution to a useful degree. Basically, a series of acquisitions of the same target are registered from the onboard antenna while moving at the instants Δt, and then opportunely combined together to mimic the behaviour of a larger antenna. The amplitudes of the multiple acquisitions slowly vary while the phases of the signal can be adjusted according to geometric considerations, and the various contributions coherently summed. Following the approach, azimuth resolution in the order of a few metres can be easily reached (synthetizing an antenna of roughly thousands of metres), at the cost of additional processing efforts after the image’s acquisition.\nAcross-track (range) resolution is determined by the bandwidth of the system, i.e., the bandwidth and length of the radar pulse used to illuminate the ground.\nUsually, the pulse repetition frequency ranges from a few hundred to a few thousand Hertz for airborne and spaceborne systems, respectively. The pulse transmitted by the SAR interacts with the Earth’s surface and only a portion of it is backscattered to the receiving antenna, which can be the same as the transmit antenna (for a monostatic radar) or a different one (for bi- or multi-static radar systems). The amplitude and the phase of the backscattered signal depend on the physical (i.e., geometry, roughness) and electrical (i.e., permittivity) properties of the imaged object, the characteristic of the radar sensor, as well as the propagation media. The width of the acquired swath from spaceborne SAR systems varies typically from 5 to 500 km. The spatial resolution of satellite SAR images depends on several parameters. The interested reader should refer to one of the many tutorials now available on SAR systems (see references).\nSentinel-1 images, used in EGMS, have a spatial resolution of about 20 m x 5 m in azimuth and ground-range. Figure 5 shows an example of an amplitude image acquired by the Sentinel-1 system. The image is in SAR coordinates (range and azimuth).\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Example of a radar (amplitude) image. To limit the inherent ‘speckle’ noise found in radar images, the amplitude values from 30 Sentinel-1 images acquired over the area of interest have been averaged."

Sentinel-1A revisits every 12 days, and with the identical Sentinel-1B in a diametrically opposed orbit, 180 degrees apart, the two acquisitions combined equal a possible 6-day revisiting time, as applied over Europe.\nCoupled with revisiting times are the concepts of a) the relative position of the SAR instrument between acquisitions (baseline), b) the absolute position of the SAR sensor at time of acquisition (orbit state vectors), and c), the precision of the sensor trajectory through space (orbital tube).

    "text": "2.4 Polarisation\nImaging radar systems typically transmit a polarised radar pulse, i.e., the electric field associated with each radar pulse oscillates in a specific plane (usually vertical or horizontal with reference to the ground). This has clear implications for the signal-to-target interaction depending on the relative size and orientation of both. Depending on the structure of a target, different backscattering can occur when it is hit by signals of different orientation (a crop for example). SAR ‘polarimetry’ is therefore employed to learn more about a target and to aid with classification. The polarisation mode generally employed by the Sentinel-1 SAR instrument is vertical. The system can, however, record both vertical and horizontal polarised signals. In general, SAR data can be: HH (horizontal transmit, horizontal receive), VV, HV, or VH. Sentinel-1 data are VV and VH. It should be noted that in EGMS only single-polarisation, co-polarized, data (VV), acquired by Sentinel-1 sensors are used.\n\n\n\nFigure 6 Example of electromagnetic wave polarization applied to remote sensing.

    "text": "2.5 Geometrical distortion\nA set of points evenly sampled in range direction, for an undulating topography, can correspond to an irregular set of points in ground range. The area associated to each pixel of a radar image is not constant and depends on the local slope. Terrain slopes facing the sensor are ‘compressed’ into a few samples, while a much higher data sampling is obtained along the opposite slope (assuming the area is not in shadow, i.e., has not been reached by a radar signal and so does not generate any radar return).\nSince image pixels can correspond to terrain patches with different extents, the amplitude of the radar return can vary accordingly. Slopes facing the sensor are said to be affected by foreshortening and typically correspond to very bright pixels. This is because the resolution cell can be hundreds of meters in ground range, and more power can be backscattered towards the radar compared to flat terrain. On the contrary, slopes facing the opposite direction appear dark, local incidence angles are high, and spatial sampling is better than that over flat terrain as the resolution cell now shrinks to a few meters.\nAnother effect visible in mountainous areas or in urban areas where tall buildings are present is called layover. This occurs when the radar beam reaches the top of a mountain or a tall feature before it reaches the base - the return signal from the top is received by the sensor before the signal from the bottom. As a result, the top of the mountain is displaced towards the radar from its true position on the ground, and ‘lays over’ the base.\nAll these effects of geometric distortion are visible in Figure 7.\n\n\n\nFigure 7: SAR amplitude image acquired over the Vesuvius volcano. Studying a range line passing through the caldera (section A-A’) shows pixels affected by foreshortening, layover, and shadowing, as well as areas characterised by good spatial sampling (although with low reflectivity values) along the slides facing away from the sensor (adapted from Ferretti, 2014)."

The angle between true north-south and the satellite’s orbit varies slightly, depending on the mission, but in general lies in the range of ten degrees. By combining the rotation of the Earth and the orbital paths of the satellites, the entire surface of the Earth is illuminated by two different satellite geometries. When the satellite travels in a descending orbit, meaning that it travels from north to south, it views a target area looking westward (in right-looking mode), while during its ascending orbit, that is, when it moves from south back to the north, it views the same target area looking eastward.\nBy acquiring data in both geometries over an area of interest that is characterised by rough topography, it is possible to achieve a more effective spatial sampling since areas affected by foreshortening or layover in one acquisition geometry will correspond (if not in shadow) to slopes well sampled by the other acquisition geometry.\nThe possibility of collecting data in two opposite acquisition geometries over any area of interest is a key feature that can be exploited successfully to recover two components of the displacement field affecting the area of interest from multiple InSAR observations (Figure 8b).\n\n\n\nFigure 8: All modern satellite SAR sensors orbit the Earth in a near-polar orbit.

The signal-angle, or phase, at the sensor for each pixel of a SAR image is determined by two main contributions:\n\nThe delay between transmission and reception of the radar pulse.\nThe interaction between the incident electromagnetic waves and the scatterers within a ground resolution cell.\n\nDue to the physical differences between resolution cells and the random distribution of the elementary scatterers corresponding to each pixel, each having a certain distance from the sensor, phase values, even from neighbouring pixels within a single SAR image, are unrelated, random, and of no practical use. It is only when corresponding pixels from two SAR images of the same place acquired at different times (and/or from slightly different angles) are compared that the phase values can provide useful information.\nInSAR is therefore a technique that exploits the difference in backscattered phase between two different satellite images of the same place acquired at different times or from different angles, the result being an interferogram. In fact, whenever the ‘radar signature’ of the radar target does not change between two SAR acquisitions (i.e. the interaction between the radar signal and the object is almost identical), the resulting interferometric fringes can be exploited to measure possible variations in the optical path of the signal: InSAR can then be used either to recover the local topography of the area of interest (by changing the location of the radar antenna) or to measure possible variations in the positioning of the object in the satellite’s line of sight, i.e. movement.\n\n\n\nFigure 9 Formation of an interferogram."

    "section": "4.2 Interferometric phase components",
    "text": "4.2 Interferometric phase components\nThere are several factors that contribute to the phase, , of a pixel P of a SAR image, namely:\n\n\n\n\nwhere  is the phase component associated with the interaction between the radar signal and the elementary scatterers within the resolution cell (dependent on the material and the location of the scatterers), 2r is the 2-way travel path (i.e., r is the sensor-to-target distance measured along the satellite line of sight),  is the system wavelength,  is the phase component induced by propagation effects and n is the noise.\nWhenever an interferogram is generated, by computing the difference of the phase values of homologous pixels belonging to two satellite SAR images acquired at different times over the same area of interest, the interferometric phase , i.e., the phase of each pixel of the interferogram, is then the sum of the following (main) components:\n\n\n\n\n\n − Displacement component: Due to any difference in the position of the target between the two SAR images, measured in the line of sight of the satellite. The displacement component is normally the part of interest that algorithms aim to identify. This is the case for EGMS.\n − Atmospheric component: Due to atmospheric perturbation of the electromagnetic waves emitted by the SAR system. In fact, the speed of propagation of the radar signal, directly impacting on the phase values of the detected image, depends on many factors, such as: the amount of tropospheric moisture, temperature and pressure of the different atmospheric layers, the total electron content in the ionosphere, etc. The atmospheric component is normally considered a disturbance and its reliable determination is one of the main challenges in InSAR data processing.\n − Topographic component: Induced by different acquisition geometries at the time of the acquisition. This phase component can be strongly reduced by taking advantage of prior information about the local topography (e.g., using a Digital Elevation Model – DEM - of the area of interest) and accurate satellite orbit state vectors describing the acquisition geometries. In multi-interferogram analyses (such as those used in EGMS), requirements on the accuracy of the DEM used in the processing are not strict (accuracy of 10m are fine), since errors can be estimated and compensated for from the analysis of many interferograms acquired over the same area.\n - Noise: This term is the sum of two contributions: one due to variations in acquisition geometry that will affect the whole image (geometric decorrelation), and the other due to any temporal decorrelation of features within the image, such as changing vegetation, ploughed fields, demolition/construction of buildings(temporal decorrelation). As these types of noise become more pronounced, InSAR analysis become more challenging.\n\nAn example of a SAR interferogram is shown in Figure 10. The displacement field (corresponding to the component  in eq. 2) generated by the Mw 6.3 L’Aquila earthquake (6th April 2009) is clearly visible in the interferogram. The acquisition geometries of the two SAR images used to generate the interferogram were similar, strongly limiting the topographic contribution (). However, large areas are affected by phase noise (decorrelation) and almost no useful information can be extracted from these areas. Moreover, even in areas where noise contributions are low, atmospheric disturbances create low frequency phase components  that hinder the analysis of the co-seismic displacement field.\nUsually, not all pixels in a SAR interferogram contain useful information. In fact, even if the phase of all pixels is composed of the components shown in the eq. 1, whenever the noise component is significant and overwhelming, no useful estimation can be obtained. Pixels or patches of pixels which contain useful information are known as coherent, and the indicator normally used to identify these points and zones is called interferometric coherence. Additional details about the interferometric coherence will be given in section Section 5.4.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: Example of a SAR differential interferogram (after removal of topographic components). Interferometric fringes are generated by the co-seismic deformation pattern caused by the L’Aquila earthquake in Italy (April 2009). Images acquired by Cband SAR with approximate 5.6 cm wavelength, meaning each interferometric fringe represents approximately 28 mm displacement in the satellite line of sight. SAR data acquired by ESA’s Envisat mission.\n\n\nAll interferograms can be categorised using two main parameters: the temporal baseline (), and the normal baseline (), more precisely:\n\n is the time that separates the acquisition of the two images used to generate an interferogram. Intuitively, the shorter the period of separation, the higher the signal-to-noise ratio of the interferogram, and the better the phase coherence (i.e., ). In areas only slightly affected by temporal decorrelation (e.g., rock deserts, urban environments), even long periods of separation (high values of temporal baseline) do not necessarily affect signal quality. Those are the kind of radar targets most suitable for multi-temporal InSAR analysis.\n is the difference in position of the sensor between the two acquisitions, directly proportional to the change in incidence angle of the radar beam. The larger the normal baseline, the more sensitive the system to local topography, although the quality of the interferometric phase decreases. There is in fact a practical limit to the normal baseline, called critical baseline, where the differing view angles become so large that the phase signal becomes decorrelated and no useful information can be extracted. The critical baseline depends on the acquisition geometry and the bandwidth of the radar and, in the case of Sentinel-1, is around 8,000 m, much larger than the ‘orbital tube’ defined for the Sentinel-1 mission, which is less than 100 m (i.e., given any two acquisitions over a certain area the probability that the distance between the two orbital paths is more than 100 m is extremely low).\n\nEvery interferometric fringe in the interferogram corresponds to displacement along the satellite line-of-sight of λ/2 (due to the two-way travel path). Provided the displacement field is spatially correlated, the fringe pattern would resemble a set of contour lines and the actual deformation would then be computed after a phase unwrapping procedure, adding the proper number of phase cycles to each pixel of the image, starting from a reference point P0. In fact, InSAR measurements are never absolute: without prior information, data always refer to a point selected within the SAR image, supposed motionless or with known elevation/motion.\nAlmost all phase unwrapping algorithms assume that the true unwrapped phase field is ‘smooth’ and varies ‘slowly’ in space. More precisely, neighbouring phase values are supposed to be within one-half cycle (πradians) of one another. Similar hypotheses are used to unwrap along the time direction whenever displacement data are estimated from a long temporal series of SAR images acquired over the same area of interest at different times. Phase unwrapping is one of the most difficult steps in InSAR data processing for which only sub-optimal solutions can often be identified, especially when using only two SAR images (i.e. one interferogram). Ground movements that cause unwrapping difficulties include abrupt, discontinuous, or rapid displacements.\nApart from the processing difficulties presented by phase ambiguity, the need for phase unwrapping implies that all InSAR measurements are relative to a reference point and are not ‘absolute’. That is the reason why EGMS uses GNSS data to calibrate all InSAR data, making it (almost) independent of the selection of the reference point used in the processing.\nReferences:\n\nBamler, R. and Hartl P.

    "text": "4.3 Multi-interferogram techniques\nAs discussed in the previous sections, the interferometric technique involves a phase comparison of SAR images, gathered at different times with slightly different looking angles. The technology has the potential to detect millimetre range variations, although, apart from cycle ambiguity problems, practical limitations are found in temporal and geometrical decorrelation and atmospheric artefacts.\nAtmospheric components show a strong spatial correlation within every single SAR acquisition, but they are uncorrelated in time. Conversely, target motion is usually strongly correlated in time and can exhibit different degrees of spatial correlation depending on the phenomenon at hand.\nTo improve the accuracy of InSAR measurements, compared to conventional analyses and to filter-out atmospheric effects, it is useful to work on a set of SAR acquisitions, rather than just two images, thus adopting a multi-interferogram approach. If the number of phase contributions to be dealt with is to be limited, the analysis should focus on coherent scatterers only (Figure 11), i.e., radar targets only slightly affected by temporal and geometrical decorrelation and that exhibit stable reflectivity values, known as either Permanent or Persistent Scatterers (PS). In Persistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI), preserving the information associated with point-wise coherent scatterers (the PS) that might be surrounded by noisy pixels, means no spatial filtering is performed on the interferograms.\nTo keep the mathematical framework simple, all interferograms are generated using a single primary image and displacement values are estimated selecting a single reference point, common to all interferograms.\nThe concepts expressed in the previous paragraphs are the basic ingredients of any PSI technique, where the final goal is the estimation of the elevation and possible displacement for each PS identified within an area of interest, jointly exploiting all SAR scenes of the interferometric data-stack.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: a) multi-interferogram techniques aim at identifying coherent radar targets (referred to as persistent scatterers) that are only slightly affected by phase decorrelation. b) Given a data stack of multi-temporal SAR acquisitions, the analysis is carried out on a sparse PS grid, rather than on all image pixels. c) After PS identification and reference point selection, atmospheric effects are estimated and removed taking advantage of their statistical behaviour. The APS superimposed on each SAR image is almost uncorrelated in time, but is correlated spatially, while displacement phase components are usually correlated in time. (Adapted from Ferretti, 2014).\n\n\nThere are several multi-interferogram processing techniques that differ mainly in the rules used to choose the image-pairs processed that make the individual interferograms which are then processed collectively. Any two SAR images of the same place can be processed to obtain an interferogram, but only those conforming to specific parameters will yield useful data.\nThe SAR images that make up an interferometric pair can be defined in terms of their temporal and normal baselines that, for some techniques, must both fulfil certain thresholds and limits.\nAs mentioned, the various multi-interferogram techniques differ mainly in the set of rules used to establish which image pairs shall be interferometrically processed. Many tutorials are available. The interested readers should refer to the bibliographic references at the end of this section.\nThree established methods are outlined below:\n\nPersistent Scatterer Interferometry (PSI): In a set of N SAR images, one is selected as a reference, normally in the temporal centre of the dataset to minimize the dispersion of the temporal baseline values. N-1 interferometric pairs are established between the reference image and the remaining N-1, resulting in the generation of N-1 interferograms. All the interferograms are used in the processing (except those showing strong decorrelation effects over large portions of the image due, for instance, to snow coverage).\nAdvanced Methods based on both PS and DS: In a set of N images all possible interferograms are generated, by computing the coherence matrix of each image pixel. An optimum set of N phase values is then extracted from each matrix. After the estimation of the optimum phase values, the processing follows the steps used by most PSI algorithms. An example of these algorithms is SqueeSAR® (Ferretti et al., 2011).\nSmall Baseline Subset (SBAS): Thresholds for the normal and temporal baselines are established and then all image-pairs according to these thresholds are processed. Consequently, there is no single primary scene. The SBAS approach reduces issues caused by temporal decorrelation because of the shorter spatial and temporal thresholds imposed. However, as not all interferometric pairs are used in the processing, results can suffer more from fading signals affecting DS, at least whenever the number of interferograms is kept to a minimum (Ansari et al., 2021).\n\nAnother differentiator between different multi-interferogram techniques is their focus on different families of radar targets, which will be the subject of the next section.\nReferences:\n\nFerretti, A., Prati, C. and Rocca, F., 2001.

    "section": "4.4 Pointwise and Distributed Scatterers",
    "text": "4.4 Pointwise and Distributed Scatterers\nThere are two main families of persistent scatterer that can be identified in a SAR image; ‘Pointwise’ and ‘Distributed’ (Figure 12). Both are part of EGMS products.\n\nPointwise scatterers (PS): These are ground features creating a dominant scattering centre within the resolution cell they belong to, strongly limiting any phase decorrelation effects due to different acquisition geometries. In fact, whenever there is a strong, dominant, scatterer within a resolution cell the interference effects between different scatterers almost disappear. Point scatterers are usually characterised by high reflectivity values and stable phase values. Objects that make good radar targets are varied and can be natural or man-made. Among the natural forms are rock outcrops, hard unvegetated earth surfaces, boulders, etc. Among the artificial objects are buildings, streetlights, transmission towers, bridge parapets, above-ground pipelines, features on dams and roof structures, and any rectilinear structure that can create a dihedral that reflects the radar signal back to the satellite (Perissin and Ferretti, 2007). PS density depends heavily on terrain cover: vegetated areas exhibit a low density of radar targets suitable for InSAR measurements, while urban areas are favourable for PS analyses. No measurement points are identified over water and in general where radar reflectivity changes with time.\nDistributed scatterers (DS): These are ground features that individually do not show strong amplitude, nor a very stable phase, yet, when combined via averaging, their spatial and electromagnetic homogeneity allows specific algorithms to amplify their radar response. Although many PS can be identified in urban areas, DS are much more common in natural environments and, even although often affected by geometrical decorrelation, can exhibit good coherence levels even in interferograms with temporal baselines of many years, provided that normal baselines values are kept low. To enhance signal-to-noise ratios (SNR), interferograms should be filtered spatially, and only pixels exhibiting good coherence in many interferograms should be considered for analysis.\n\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Point scatterers (PS) vs distributed scatterers (DS).\n\n\nMulti-interferogram techniques based on the SBAS approach focus on DS, while PSI algorithms aim to detect and exploit (mostly) PS. Lately, a growing number of InSAR processing algorithms (such as SqueeSAR®) try to extract information from both families of radar targets.\nThe utilisation of both pointwise and distributed scatterers allows multi-interferogram techniques to effectively retrieve data over varying landcover types (Figure 12). The most advanced techniques process the two families of scatterers jointly, in a single process.\nWhile point scatterers are relatively simple to handle, distributed scatterers, by nature of their spatially distributed nature, must be consciously managed. In fact, any spatial averaging should be carried out only on pixels exhibiting similar reflectivity values (and possibly affected by the same displacement), which should be identified using specific statistical approaches. Moreover, as pointed out in recent publications (Ansari et al., 2021), DS can be affected by “fading signals” that can bias the estimation of ground motion.\nReferences:\n\nPerissin D. and Ferretti A.

    "section": "5.2 Image Co-registration",
    "text": "5.2 Image Co-registration\nCo-registration involves the resampling of all secondary images onto the grid of the primary one, to ensure pixel-to-pixel alignment. Accurate co-registration is fundamental to InSAR processing, as it ensures individual targets on the ground contribute to the same pixel in all images of the dataset.\n\n\n\nFigure 15 Co-registration workflow.\n\n\nCo-registration must compensate for several factors including:\n\nDifferent acquisition geometries originating from non-identical orbital paths.\nDifferent sensor parameters (e.g., sampling rates, PRF, velocities), although these effects are minimised in EGMS, as all SAR data are acquired by two twin satellites (Sentinel-1A and Sentinel-1B).\n\nThe first step in co-registration is the 2D resampling of the secondary image based on the satellite state vectors of the two images (primary and secondary) and a digital elevation model of the area of interest. The estimation of (re)sampling parameters is then refined via local cross-correlation analyses over small image patches, recovering possible errors introduced by orbital errors, timing errors, etc. The precision of satellite state vectors provided by ESA for the Copernicus missions is extremely high and, in some processing chains, the resampling is carried based on the orbital data only, without any cross-correlation step.\nAs already mentioned, SAR data used for EGMS is acquired by Sentinel-1 in Interferometric Wide (IW) Swath mode that implements a new type of ScanSAR mode called ‘Terrain Observation with Progressive Scan’ (TOPS). TOPS mode aims to achieve the same coverage and resolution as ScanSAR, but with a nearly uniform signal-to-noise ratio and therefore better image quality.\nSentinel-1 IW acquisitions, although extremely effective for covering wide areas, have very tight requirements for InSAR applications. In fact, due to the TOPS acquisition mode, even a small error in the azimuth co-registration would cause artificial phase ramps within each burst (Prats et al., 2012).\n\n\n\nFigure 16 - Prats et al., 2012 - Example of along-track linear phase ramps in a TOPS interferogram due to an artificially induced azimuth constant registration error (middle). Interferogram coherence (left). The same interferogram without azimuth registration error (right).\n\n\nTypically, to avoid phase artifacts between bursts, an azimuth co-registration accuracy better than 0.001 pixels is necessary. The established method to achieve the necessary azimuth co-registration accuracy is based on Enhanced Spectral Diversity (Scheiber, 2000; Prats, 2012), which is at the core of all co-registration algorithms used in Sentinel-1 InSAR applications. This resampling technique is applied as a second step (after the first resampling based on DEM and satellite state vectors) whenever a multi-burst approach is adopted for data processing.\nReferences:\n\nAdam, N.

    "text": "5.3 Generation of differential interferograms\nInSAR is based on the measurement of phase changes.Operationally, an interferogram is made by multiplying the complex values of one SAR image by the complex conjugate of another one, after they have been properly resampled (co-registered) on the same grid:\n\n\n\n\nThe first image is conventionally called the ‘primary’ image, while the second is the ‘secondary’ one (hence the subscript M and S to the complex values z, the amplitude values (A) and the phase components ()). For each pixel P, the differences of the phase components can be expressed by the equation (2) introduced in Section Section 4.2 that we report here for convenience:\n\nwhere  is the phase shift introduced by the target displacement d between the two acquisitions,  is a phase contribution induced by different atmospheric conditions at the time of the acquisitions,  is a component due to the changes in the acquisition geometry (i.e., non-zero geometrical baseline), strongly dependent on the local topography, and  is the noise (not only thermal, but including also temporal and geometrical decorrelation phenomena impacting on the phase value of the pixel).\nAny multi-interferogram technique aiming at detecting and monitoring ground deformation must perform three main tasks:\n\nIdentify pixels characterized by high SNR (low noise, ).\nEstimate and remove atmospheric effects ().\nEstimate local displacements compensating for possible topographic effects ().\n\nThe process is not trivial since phase values are known modulo-2π and the proper number of phase cycles has to be estimated by means of a phase unwrapping algorithm. However, one should consider any InSAR processing chain as a process starting from a set of interferograms - where phase values are a blend of different signal components – and aiming at separating the different phase contributions (Figure 17).\n\n\n\nFigure 17 Multi-interferogram algorithms aim at exploiting multi-temporal InSAR data stacks for separating different phase components: target displacement, topography dependent components and atmospheric effects.\n\n\nThis problem can be made more tractable by using: (a) an estimate of the local topography; (b) a statistical description of the signals to be estimated or removed and (c) a model of the variation of the interferometric phase in the neighborhood of a generic pixel ,) namely:\n\n\n\n Where  is a constant proportional to the normal baseline () of the interferogram,  is error in the DEM used to compensate the topographic component and d is target displacement to be estimated.\nIn fact, an estimation of the local topography is always available (as a minimum, one could consider the Earth ellipsoid as an a priori model) and the “raw” interferograms can be compensated for the phase contribution expected from this topography. The process is sketched in Figure 18, where the “synthetic interferogram” obtained from the DEM and the satellite state vectors, is subtracted from the original interferogram obtaining a differential interferogram, where atmospheric contributions and possible phase components due to surface deformation become visible. A differential interferogram is then an interferogram where baselinerelated phase components have been estimated and (mostly) removed using an a priori DEM.\n\n\n\nFigure 18 Differential interferogram generation (adapted from Ferretti, 2014). In the original and the synthetic interferogram phase components related to the “flat Earth” model have been removed for visualization purposes.\n\n\nFrom Eq. (4) it is clear that SAR interferometry can be used to optimize the DEM of an area of interest (from baseline-related phase components) and to detect surface deformation phenomena. The sensitivity, however, is quite different. Local topography can be estimated with an accuracy of a few meters, while displacement fields can be detected with an accuracy of a few millimetres (ESA Manual, 2007).\nLimitations of conventional InSAR analysis, based on just two SAR images, are due to atmospheric effects and phase decorrelation related to variations of the phase reflectivity due to the acquisition geometry or the nature and the locations of elementary scatterers within the resolution cell. Moreover, as already stressed, phase values are only known modulo-2π and the proper number of phase cycles has to be estimated (for each pixel) by means of a phase unwrapping algorithm.\nReferences:\n\nESA Manual, 2007 - http://www.esa.int/esapub/tm/tm19/TM-19_ptA.pdf\nFerretti, A.

    "section": "5.4 Selection of measurement points",
    "text": "5.4 Selection of measurement points\nOnce all differential interferograms are ready, EGMS processing chains identify a set of measurement points candidates (MPC). Proper identification of high coherence scatterers is paramount in estimating and compensating for the atmospheric disturbances. In fact, the better the selection, the higher the probability of a reliable phase unwrapping and an effective estimation of the atmospheric components.\nFor MPCs selection, there are two main categories of estimators:\n\nAmplitude-based algorithms.\nPhase-based algorithms.\n\n\n5.4.1 Amplitude Data – Dispersion Index and Signal-To-Clutter Ratio\nEstimators belonging to this class are based on the idea that points exhibiting high and consistent amplitude values of their radar return in time, do also show a good phase stability over the same period. In other words, the stability of the radar cross section of the target is used as a proxy for phase stability. The idea can be easily illustrated with a graphical approach (Ferretti et al., 2001).\n\n\n\nFigure 19 Model behind the use of the amplitude dispersion index (DA) as a proxy for phase stability. The complex noise is supposed to be circular and Gaussian having the same standard deviation  for both the real and the imaginary component.  represents the incoherent average of all the signal vectors A. If the signal-to-noise ratio is well above the value of 1, the ratio between  and  is a good estimator of the phase dispersion ).\n\n\nIf the power of the complex circular Gaussian noise affecting the radar signal is much lower than the power of the signal, we do not expect strong variations of the signal phase. Introducing the temporal coherence , we can write (again, for additive circular Gaussian noise affecting the data):\n\nTherefore, low values of the amplitude dispersion index, that is the ratio between the mean and the standard deviation of the amplitude values of the SAR images, computed on a pixel-by-pixel basis (with no spatial smoothing), can allow one to identify pointwise, coherent scatterers within the SAR scene. Typically, more than 20 scenes should be available to get reliable estimates of this index: this hypothesis is always met in EGMS. The pixels with DA values lower than 0.25 are considered good MPC.\nA second methodology is based on the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). This approach is based on the same signal model used for developing the Dispersion Index method described above. This time the noise (clutter) power is estimated from neighbouring pixels (Figure 20). The original approach was developed to check the phase stability of corner reflectors (CEOS, 1993). Whenever a temporal series of SAR images is available over the area, the figure of interest is the average value of the SCR in all SAR data.\n\n\n\nFigure 20 Computation of the signal-to-clutter ratio (SCR). A is the amplitude of the radar image. Pc is the pixel under analysis and Pi is the generic pixel of the “red areas” where the clutter power is estimated. Green pixels are considered heavily impacted by sidelobes of . Working on a SAR datastack, the SCR is computed for each image first and results are then averaged.\n\n\nSince the signal model is the same as for the detection based on the dispersion index (Adam et al. 2005, Ferretti et al., 2001):\n It should be noted that, while the dispersion index does not imply any spatial averaging of the data, for the SCR method the presence of other strong scatterers in the neighbourhood of the pixel under study can bias the estimation. The detection, however, can be effective even for data stacks of a few SAR images.\n\n\n5.4.2 Phase-based estimators\nThe second family of algorithms for MPC selection is based on phase values. The easiest approach is the computation of the spatial coherence map of each differential interferogram, defined as:\n\n\n\n\nwhere the summation is extended to a suitable 2D window W centred on pixel P. The footers M and S to the complex values z represent the pixels belonging to the ‘primary’ and the ‘secondary’ images respectively.\nRather than computing the coherence maps of all possible interferograms usually the analysis is limited to pairs of successive acquisitions (or those characterized by low Bn values, like in SBAS). Coherence maps are than averaged and those pixels exceeding a certain threshold are selected as MPC. The problem with eq. (5) is that the spatial averaging does not allow one to operate on a pixel-by-pixel basis (i.e., single-look). It is therefore difficult to detect pointwise targets surrounded by clutter. To improve the spatial resolution of the estimation a different approach is implemented. Rather than working on the average spatial coherence (), MPC are selected based on the modulus of the temporal coherence:\n\n\n\n\nWhere P represents the single pixel that the evaluation is performed upon, N is the number of images, and () the different pixel phase values in the images. Since the selection of MP must be carried before the estimation and removal of atmospheric components, one can check for the phase stability of pixel P vs. the mean value of the interferometric phase , estimated over a suitable (local) window centred on P, where atmospheric components should be very similar:\n\n\n\n\nMore advanced multi-interferogram techniques generate, for each pixel, a coherence matrix containing all possible interferograms that can be generated from the SAR data stack. The temporal coherence is then estimated as a measure of consistency of the different phase variations (Ferretti et al., 2011).\n\n5.4.2.1 PS and DS\nPersistent (pointwise) Scatterers (PS) are pre-existing ground featuresthat serendipitously but reliably reflect the incident radar signal back to the satellite from one image acquisition to the next. PS correspond to dominant scatterers within their resolution cells, exhibiting a very stable value of reflectivity as a function of time and possible variations in acquisition geometry. Most PS derive from built structures or rocky outcrops. Urban environments provide for dense arrays of PS. Because of these characteristics, PS are not found in more rural, vegetated environments. To help overcome this limitation of InSAR, new algorithms were developed to exploit ‘Distributed Scatterers’ (DS).\nDistributed Scatterers (DS): Many non-urban landcover types exhibit a fairly good amount of phase coherence in some interferograms, but not enough on a pixel-by-pixel basis to scatter sufficient signal back to the radar sensor to reliably overcome the noise. By combining the radar signal of pixels that are contiguous into one, larger ‘distributed scatterer’, the SNR level can be improved, and the dispersion of the phase values strongly reduced.\n\n\n\nFigure 21 PS (blue) and 3 families of DSs (orange, green, and grey).\n\n\nDS processing can be summarized by the following steps:\n\nIdentification of the various DS families in the area of interest: Analyze and group together contiguous points showing the same statistical behavior (usually referred to as Statistically Homogeneous Pixels – SHP).\nRadar returns of all points in the same family are averaged.\nAll points belonging to a DS are then processed as if they were a PS.\n\nIt should be noted that the signal associated with a DS is always a combination of radar returns from many pixels exhibiting similar radar returns. Therefore, while in PSI analyses there is no loss of spatial resolution, whenever DS are considered, the final results refer to a “patch of terrain” rather than a single resolution cell.\nEGMS data and processing algorithms (with the exception of SqueeSAR® which naturally deals with both families of scatterers) are based primarily on PSI algorithms and InSAR techniques based on DS are introduced only for complementing PS results in areas where the density of pointwise scatterers does not meet the project’s requirements.\nMeasurement points belonging to the DS family are characterized by a non-zero value of a processing parameter called “Effective Area“, corresponding to a rough estimation - without considering the local topography - of the extent of the DS in m2 (usually corresponding to &gt;20 pixels). For more information about DS the reader should refer to (Ferretti et al., 2011).\nReferences\n\nFerretti, A.

In fact, SAR signals are usually oversampled both in range and azimuth and the contribution of a single PS extends over more than one pixel. The main lobe and the sidelobes of strong scatterers are sometimes clearly visible in Sentinel-1 images. The IRF of the radar system must be taken into account while running MPC selection algorithms. For this reason, a cluster of pixels rather than just the pixel position corresponding to the exact location of the target will be detected.\n\n\n\nFigure 22 : The radar signature of a dominant scatterer resembles the impulse response function of the system. Depending on the SCR value, one single PS (the red triangle) can create many other measurement points (orange triangles).\n\n\nDifferent algorithms can be adopted to suppress these “replicas” of the true PS (Perissin and Rocca, 2006; Iglesias and Mallorqui, 2013). The tuning of their processing parameters is extremely challenging since, working on real SAR images, ground truth is almost never available. The possibility to work jointly on a long temporal series of SAR data, however, increases the reliability of this kind of algorithms, strongly reducing the presence of “false PS”, without losing the high density of PS usually available in urban areas (Perissin and Rocca, 2006).\nAn important take away of this section is that the number of MP identified by a processing chain for PSI analysis cannot be considered the most important metric for evaluating its quality. A different tuning of the sidelobe suppression algorithm (or simply the absence of it) can dramatically change the density of MP, in particular over urban areas.\nReferences\n\nCEOS SAR Calibration Workshop, ESTEC, Noordwijk, Netherlands, September 1993.\nAdam, N., Kampes, B. and Eineder, M., 2005, April.

    "text": "5.5 Phase unwrapping\nIn the PS technique, differential interferograms are unwrapped on the sparse grid of PS candidates (PSC) using a procedure that effectively takes into account all available information (i.e., all available images). Usually, a constant velocity model is applied on phase variations between neighbouring pixels, where the impact of atmospheric components is assumed to be very similar and so cancels out in the difference. Therefore, the phase model can be written as follows:\n\nSince phase values are wrapped, DEM error () and the displacement rate () are estimated by maximizing the temporal coherence:\n\nPhase differences are then unwrapped taking advantage of the estimated values of relative velocity and relative elevation of each pair of high coherent scatterers (the MPC), for all arcs of a network connecting all MPC.\n\n\n\nFigure 23 A graph of MPC. Links represent phase differences between the points. Each arc is weighted with temporal coherence.\n\n\nIt should be noted that this approach can cope with non-uniform target motion, as long as the non-linear component of the displacement does not impact on the actual number of phase cycles to be added to the wrapped phase values (Figure 24). In other words: phase unwrapping procedures based on the linear model can still allow one to correctly estimate the number of phase cycles for some points affected by non-linear behaviour.\nEGMS is based on a linear phase unwrapping approach.\n\n\n\nFigure 24 Example showing a phase unwrapping procedure based on a linear model for target motion. In (a) the true motion of the target (black samples) in not perfectly linear, but phase unwrapping based on the linear model can still provide the correct number of phase cycles, while in (b) the model (dashed red line) leads to underestimation of target motion and wrong estimation of phase cycles for several interferograms (red samples).\n\n\nOnce the unwrapped values of the phase variations between nearby MPC have been estimated, phase data are then integrated. Since the result of the global optimization process at the core of any phase unwrapping algorithm is restricted to be a set of integers, many of the procedures used for matrix inversion or integration of local differences do not provide the best results or they simply provide the wrong answer. In fact, one should rely on algorithms based on integer programming, region growing techniques, iterative Lp-norm optimization, graph theory or network flow (Costantini, 1998; Chen, 2001; Ferretti et al., 2007).\nIn EGMS two families of algorithms are used to unwrap the interferograms:\n\nAlgorithms based on network flow (Costantini, 1998; Chen, 2001).\nAlgorithms based on iterative Lp-norm optimizations (Ghiglia and Pritt, 1998).\n\nPhase unwrapping is, for sure, the most challenging processing step in any InSAR analysis. In fact, in general, if not a priori information about the phase values is available, i.e., no constraint is given to the solution, phase unwrapping is an ill-posed inverse problem (Ferretti, 2007) and therefore an infinite number of different solutions can be found, all honouring the data (a solution is said to honour the data if its modulo-2π version is identical to the original interferogram).\nIt should be noted, however, that the joint use of many interferograms can be extremely beneficial for estimating the correct number of phase cycles in each of them. In fact, almost all phase unwrapping algorithms assume that the true unwrapped phase field is “smooth” and varies “slowly”. If only one interferogram is available, neighbouring phase values are supposed to be within one-half cycle ( radians) of one another. The joint analysis based on an InSAR data-stack can allow one to relax this hypothesis and correctly perform the phase unwrapping also in areas affected by strong, local, phase variations, provided that the model estimated from the images available can describe the phase variations with an error always less than half a cycle.\nReferences\n\nMonti Guarnieri, A.

    "text": "5.6 Atmospheric denoising and discrimination of displacement information\nThe propagation of the radar signal is affected by different phenomena taking place both in the ionosphere and the troposphere, generating an “extra-delay”. Consequently, the analysis of the phase values of SAR interferogram must consider the Atmospheric Phase Screen (APS) associated with every SAR acquisition.\n\n\n\nFigure 25 (a) Example of propagation anomalies generated by atmospheric stratification. The area of interest is the Etna volcano in Sicily. Interferometric fringes resemble the contour lines of the volcano. (b) Amplitude data and differential interferogram over the Po valley in Italy. Fringes are generated by tropospheric effects.\n\n\nThe main contributions of the APS are the following (Adam, 2019; Hanssen, 2001):\n\nIonospheric effects - These effects can be quite important for low frequency radar sensors(operating at frequency lower than Sentinel-1), especially for regional mapping, but have a limited impact in InSAR analyses based on X-band or C-band sensors, at least at mid-latitudes. Variations of the free electron density usually give rise to phase artefacts well modelled by low-order polynomials (even over areas of thousands of square kilometres), which can be dealt with quite easily.\nAtmospheric turbulence (wet delay) - Variations in water vapour density can create measurable changes in signal propagation velocity, generating phase artefacts in multi-temporal SAR analyses (Figure 25b). The spatial correlation of this kind of phenomena can be described, in geostatistics, by a specific variogram (Wackernagel, 2003). The correlation length of turbulence phenomena can vary from 1 to 10 km but, in general, is much shorter than that associated with ionospheric effects.\nAtmospheric stratification (dry delay) - Apart from turbulence phenomena, vertical stratification of the atmosphere into layers of different propagation velocities (i.e., different indexes of refraction at different elevations) causes additional atmospheric delays in mountainous regions, strongly correlated to the local topography (Figure 25a).\n\nIn multi-interferogram techniques, once phase data are unwrapped, it is possible to estimate and (partially) remove the atmospheric components superimposed on each interferogram, taking advantage of their statistical description, and considering a proper model to describe the motion of the radar targets.\nIf no prior information is available, the motion of each MPC is modelled (in time) as a low order polynomial plus a seasonal component. Both DEM error and polynomial coefficients are then estimated for each PSC by solving a linear system of equations:\n\nwhere  is the order of the polynomial, temporal baseline values are expressed in years and , …  are coefficients to be estimated. In EGMS, the availability of hundreds of Sentinel-1 acquisitions all over Europe makes it possible to avoid any major problem with overfitting.\nAfter solving the linear system above for each measurement point where phase values have been unwrapped, phase residues with respect to the model are interpolated and low-pass filtered in space and high-pass filtered in time. Low-frequency components of the phase residues (in time) can be related to unmodeled displacement components and should not be considered as atmospheric effects.\nThis filtering procedure takes into account our knowledge about atmospheric phase components: they are expected to be spatially correlated, but uncorrelated in time. In fact, atmospheric conditions change quickly with time; therefore, given the typical temporal baseline of satellite InSAR measurements, propagation effects are considered uncorrelated in time.\nAfter filtering, estimated atmospheric components are interpolated on the regular image grid, taking into account their variograms (spatial correlation) and the local topography. In fact, based on the previous discussion, considering both ionospheric and tropospheric effects, we can model the extra path generated by atmospheric effects as follows (Ferretti et al., 2005; Even et al., 2010):\n where r and x are the range and the azimuth coordinate,  is the component of the extra path length due to turbulence phenomena, h is the elevation of pixel P(r, x) and , , and  are four constants regressed from the data during the processing.\nSome observations are now in order:\n\nSince all interferograms have a common primary scene and the atmospheric phase screen (APS) of each interferogram is actually the difference between the APS of primary and that of the secondary image, the mean of all APS is an estimate of the APS of the primary image.\nThe APS estimated by the PS approach is actually the sum of tropospheric effects (turbulence phenomena and atmospheric stratification effects), as well as ionospheric effects.\nAn optimum filtering of the atmospheric components would be possible if we could characterize the spectrum (or the variogram) of the displacement field affecting the area of interest. This is rarely the case and that is the reason why APS estimation procedures focus on a simple model for the displacement signal and a statistical analysis of the atmospheric components.\nIn WAP analyses, rather than using kriging techniques (Wackernagel, 2003) to interpolate the data, Inverse Distance Weighting (Zimmerman, 1999) is applied quite often, since it is much faster, and the quality of the results is not severely impacted by this simpler approach.\n\n\n5.6.1 Numerical Weather Models\nThe procedure outlined above does not rely on any prior information. Over the last decade, though, there has been a growing level of interest in the use of Numerical Weather Models (NWM) for estimating the APS of multi-temporal SAR data stacks. Since NWM data are usually characterized by a spatial resolution of 3 km (or less) and a temporal sampling of 6 hours (Adam, 2019), the use of this information source can help remove low wavenumber atmospheric components from SAR interferograms but have limited impact on local effects caused by wet delay. Today, the best results are obtained by computationally intensive algorithms, which run hindcast procedures, taking into account wind speed and direction, as well as all other meteorological parameters, and aim to estimate the APS at the time of the acquisition in the best possible way. These algorithms, however, are not always compatible with WAP analyses.\nSince APS estimation from NWM will become in the future a product associated with Sentinel1- imagery, provided by ESA, EGMS may benefit from this information source as soon as it will become available. It should be pointed out, however, that for now, EGMS products are not using NWM and are derived from a data-driven approach.\nReferences\n\nWackernagel, H. (2003).

    "text": "5.7 Generation of displacement time series for each MP\nOnce the interferograms have been compensated for atmospheric disturbances the algorithm proceeds with a pixel-by-pixel analysis. The problem is to select all points where reliable displacement information can be extracted from the available SAR scenes, correcting for spurious phase components due to DEM errors.\nA PS is then an image pixel where the dispersion of the phase values, after estimation of its precise elevation, is low with respect to the suitable displacement model. It should be noted that interferograms are not unwrapped, since phase unwrapping is carried out on a sparse PS grid only; therefore, phase unwrapping should be performed as well, in order to generate the final results.\nSince the introduction of the PS technique, different procedures have been developed to identify PS or, in general, measurement points. The interested reader can find a detailed analysis concerning the constant velocity model and for signals exhibiting a seasonal behaviour in Colesanti et al. 2003. In general, pixel P is identified as PS whenever its temporal coherence exceeds a certain threshold (Ferretti, 2001):\n4.6)\n\nwhere data () are interferometric phases compensated for atmospheric effects and model m is described by a suitable parameter vector (p), including the precise scatterer elevation (or DEM error). The threshold is set based on a Monte Carlo simulation, after fixing a false alarm rate (typically lower than 10-5): in other words, we want the probability of erroneously labelling a pixel corresponding to pure noise as an “MP” to be less than a certain threshold.\nLately there has been growing attention on non-parametric models, where the only constraint on the time series of displacement data corresponding to a measurement point is the temporal correlation of its samples. With or without a parametric model, phase data must be unwrapped, and, for all PS, their geographic coordinates are estimated taking into account their SAR coordinates and the estimated precise elevations.\nIt is important to remember that deformation phenomena with very rapid evolution, may induce a problem of ambiguity in the measurement, which can complicate the interpretation of EGMS results. In fact, on a single isolated radar target, any InSAR technique not relying on prior information about target motion only allows one to correctly measure movements of less than  (about 14mm for Sentinel-1) between two subsequent acquisitions: any movement exceeding  would be “aliased”. At the extreme, if the target moves exactly half a wavelength between two successive acquisitions, it would not be possible to detect any change compared to the case of a stable target,since no change in interferometric phase would be measured. That is the reason why it is of utmost importance, in particular for areas where just a few isolated MP are available, to run the InSAR analysis on more than one InSAR data stack. In EGMS, for all areas of interest, all the available data stacks are systematically processed.\nReferences\n\nColesanti, C., Ferretti, A., Novali, F., Prati, C. and Rocca, F. (2003a).

(a) The time series is referred to the primary image (circled in green). (b) The time series is referred to the first image in the dataset (circled in green). (c) The time series is referred to a particular noisy image (circled in green). (d) The time series is referred to the origin of the fitted model (the red line).\n\n\nFigure 26 shows a time series where the temporal reference has been set to four different epochs. In (a) the time series is referred to the time when the image used as the primary was acquired. In (b) the very same time series is referred to the first acquisition of the dataset. It should be noted that any changes of the reference time do not affect the shape of the time series, apart from a mere shift. Of course, the noise component affecting the image acquired at the date used as reference create a constant shift of the time series. This effect is highlighted in Figure 24c, in which the time series is referenced to a noisy image.\nIn order to mitigate the possible impact of unfavorable selections of the reference image and – more generally – to limit the impact of noise components (or any atmospheric leakage) superimposed on the data, the approach followed in EGMS is to refer all time series to the origin of a regression model used for coherence estimation, as shown in Figure24d of Figure 26 where the regression model is linear.\nIn EGMS the model used to estimate the temporal coherence of the MP and for computing the RMS error of each displacement time series is a third order polynomial, plus a seasonal component:\n where the unit of time is 1 year.\nAfter the regression, each time series is added a constant value so that , where t0 is the acquisition time of the first sample of the time series.\nThis approach allows one to limit the impact of noise components superimposed on the reference scene. In fact, even in case the model is not the right one to describe the displacement of the point, this approach would simply introduce a constant shift to the time series with no major impact on the measurements.\n\n\n5.7.2 Spatial Reference\nSimilarly to the construction of a “virtual temporal reference”, it is possible to adopt a similar approach for overcoming the problems related to the selection of a spatial reference point, P0. In fact, the radar benchmark used as local reference should be characterized by high phase coherence values and very stable radar return. Moreover, it should not be affected by any local displacement phenomena, since its “signature” (i.e. motion) would impact on all timeseries of the dataset.\nTo optimize the SNR, the reference point is usually selected as the point exhibiting the lowest value of the amplitude dispersion index (DA) among the PS available in the centre of the AOI. To check for a possible displacement of the reference point, one can compute the average of all timeseries in the dataset. In fact, whenever correlated in time and non-negligible, this “common mode” is due to the motion of the local benchmark. Usually, InSAR providers select the reference point as the PS minimizing the “common mode” of the dataset.\nIn EGMS, however, a different approach was chosen, which follows the rationale behind the selection of a virtual reference time described in the previous section. In fact, rather than selecting a physical point within the measurement points identified in the AOI, the estimated “signature” of the reference point is simply subtracted from all timeseries. In other words, displacement data are referred to their mean or mode value in the dataset, without searching for a the “best”, physical, measurement point.\nThe adoption of a virtual reference point can strongly limit the impact of both displacement and noise components affecting  allowing the generation of a set of timeseries which, on average, exhibit higher values of the SNR.\nFigure 27 represents the look and feel of the same data following a standard reference approach (a) and the EGMS reference approach (b). Data in panel (b) shows higher SNR level.\n\n\n\nFigure 27 look and feel of the same data (a) following a standard reference approach and (b) the EGMS reference approach.\n\n\nIt should be noted that the selection of a reference point is necessary only for Basic (L2a) products. The Calibrated (L2b) and Ortho (L3) products are anchored to the reference GNSS network, and hence the reference point motion signature is almost completely compensated, whatever its magnitude. Therefore, L2b and L3 data are much less affected by the motion of the reference point."

PSsare generally intended as scatterers that exhibit interferometric coherence for the time period and baseline span of the acquisitions, including both point-like and distributed scatterers. The PSP method overcomes the problems due to the presence in the phase of atmospheric and orbital artefacts (and, in general, disturbances slowly varying with the position in the scene) by relying, for both identification and analysis of PSs, only on the relative signal in pairs of points (hence the name PSP) close enough to be affected by the same disturbance. Therefore, the PSP technique is intrinsically robust to spatially correlated disturbances and does not need a preliminary processing aimed at compensating atmosphere and other spatially correlated contributions to the signal. Moreover, deviations from the models of displacement evolution typically used in PS techniques (e.g., due to strong nonlinear evolutions) are mitigated in the PSP approach, because close points likely have similar deviations.\n\n\nPhase Unwrapping – Signal Model\n3rd order polynomial model + seasonal pattern between pair of points [3].\n\n\nPhase Unwrapping – Algorithm\nPhase unwrapping technique described in[4] and [5].\n\n\nAtmospheric Estimation – Removal of linear phase component (planes)\nRemoval of polynomial functions + stratified components after phase unwrapping\n\n\nAtmospheric Estimation Algorithm\nInverse distance weighting for turbulent components.\n\n\nExploitation of DS\nThe PSP method does not require explicitly the identification of DS, as demonstrated in [3], [7], [8]. In fact, the PSP technique is capable of extracting the coherent information even from low-intensity SAR signals, even when strongly scattering structures are not present and the sensed signal is low and the scattering distributed, as in the case of rather smooth surfaces or natural terrains (provided they do not change with time, due to cultivation works or dense vegetation). To this purpose, the PSP algorithm does not rely on filtering that involve loss of resolution as in the case of distributed scatterer techniques but exploits the redundancy of the pair-of-point connections and keeps the full resolution of the original SAR images.\n\n\nUse of Numerical Weather Models\nNot applied.

    "section": "8.1 Input data",
    "text": "8.1 Input data\nThe Sentinel-1 mission provides the fundamental SAR data that underpins EGMS. However, to make the Basic EGMS interferometric products, other, ancillary data are also needed. This section describes the data required to make the Basic product from which the other two EGMS products are derived.\n\n8.1.1 Copernicus Sentinel-1 Mission\nThe Sentinel-1 satellites each carry a Synthetic Aperture Radar operating at C-band, i.e., a wavelength of around 5.5 cm (5.405 GHz). In the Interferometric Wide (IW) swath mode, which is the main acquisition mode over land on which EGMS is based, data is acquired at a spatial resolution of 20 m in azimuth and 5 m in range (single look). IW mode acquires three sub-swaths per image, with each sub-swath composed of a series of 9 bursts stacked in the azimuth direction. Each burst is approximately 80 Km (range) per 20 Km (azimuth), resulting in an overall 250 Km by 180 km image.\n\n\n\nFigure 29 Sentinel-1, IW acquisition mode. Each image is composed by 3 main swaths, each one being a collection of 9 bursts. https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/user-guides/sentinel-1-sar/acquisition-modes/interferometric-wide-swath\n\n\nGiven the satellite-earth relative motion, each image belongs to a specific relative orbit, that the satellites repeat every 6 days.\n\n\n\nFigure 30 Sentinel-1 constellation acquisition by relative orbit. https://sentinels.copernicus.eu/web/sentinel/missions/sentinel-1/satellite-description/orbit\n\n\nDifferent levels of Sentinel-1 image data are available to the public:\n\nLevel-0 (RAW): Intended only for very specific users as the data package contains the flow of information as obtained from the sensor, compressed, and without any post-processing. Users need to perform the same processing applied by the Payload Data Ground Segment (PDGS). See here for further information.\nLevel-1 (Single Look Complex): Main input to EGMS (and most other InSAR) processing chains. Level-1 products are obtained by application of algorithms and calibration data to Level-0 products. See here for further information.\nLevel-2 (GRD): Comprises geo-located geophysical products derived from Level-1. See here for further information.\n\nFor EGMS just Level-1 SLC products are considered.\nThere is designed-in some overlap between tracks to ensure complete coverage. These image overlaps can be useful in InSAR processing for a) inter-track validation of detected movements and b) to increase measurement point density as two different look angles are utilised.\n\n\n8.1.2 Satellite state vectors\nBecause of the geometrically controlled characteristics of InSAR, Sentinel-1 requires stringent orbit control. Satellite positioning along the orbital path must be accurate with strict pointing and timing synchronisation between interferometric pairs. Orbit positioning is defined using an Earth-relative ‘tube’ with a radius of 50 m (RMS). The satellites are kept within this tube for most of their lifetime.\n\n\n\nFigure 31 Representation of Sentinel-1 orbital tube.\n\n\nSome nominal characteristics of Sentinel-1’s orbit follow in the table below:\nTable 8 Sentinel-1 orbit characteristics\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAltitude\nInclination\nPeriod\nCycle\nTube deviation (90%)\nLocal time at ascending node\n\n\n\n\n693 km\n98.18 deg\n98.6 min.\n12 days\n±100 m\n18:00 hours\n\n\n\nPrecise orbit determination\nKnowledge of satellite positioning is required for InSAR processing, and files relating to precise orbital data for the Sentinel-1 constellation can be downloaded from the Sentinel Precise Orbit Determination (POD) Service in two main formats:\n\nRestituted orbit: The threshold for positional accuracy is 10 cm both along- and across-track (within 1-σ RMS). The file is generated within three hours of availability of the necessary GNSS data and covers one satellite orbit (plus a small extension).\nPrecise orbit: The satellite attitude accuracy is better than 0.005 degrees in pitch, yaw, and roll, independently. The file is generated within three hours of availability of the necessary GNSS data and covers one satellite orbit (plus a small extension).\n\n\n\n8.1.3 DEM\nIn EGMS, the Copernicus European DEM (COP DEM GLO-30) is used for this purpose (see https://land.copernicus.eu/user-corner/technical-library). This product is available in Geotiff 32-bit format as a continuous dataset divided into 1000 x 1000 km tiles at 25 m post-spacing with a vertical accuracy of ±7 m RMSE.\nAgainst intuition, a relatively coarse DEM can be used to synthesise an interferogram from which millimetric change can be derived. As mentioned above, the orbital positioning of Sentinel-1 is tightly controlled, and consequently the normal baseline between interferometric pairs almost never varies beyond 150 m. For this reason, the impact of possible DEM errors is always well below one phase cycle in any differential interferogram.\n\n\n8.1.4 Data for the identification of snow-covered images\nInSAR relies on targets remaining coherent between satellite image acquisitions. Any significant change in the spectral characteristics of a target will reduce coherence to an extent that no reliable measurement can be made. Snow-cover can compromise the quality of InSAR results in C-band radar (~6 cm wavelength). A proportion of EGMS coverage lies in mountainous and northern regions where snow-cover can be significant either seasonally or quasi-permanently, e.g. the Alps, parts of Scandinavia, etc. To produce reliable InSAR coverage therefore is sometimes required to use prior information for identifying areas affected by snow, such as the Copernicus Snow Cover Extent (SCE) product.\nThe SCE product has been made primarily for meteorological, flood-hazard and climate-change purposes. However, it provides a useful database by which Sentinel-1 acquisitions can be assessed for inclusion in InSAR processing. SCE is mapped daily in near-real time over continental Europe at a resolution of 500 x 500 m. Data is based on optical satellite acquisitions from calibrated (L2b) radiances collected by NASA’s Terra MODIS (Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer) mission. More information of the SCE product can be found here: https://land.copernicus.eu/global/products/sce\n\n\n8.1.5 CORINE land cover maps\nCORINE is a program run by the EEA that provides European maps of land-cover. Following four previous surveys in 1990, 2000, 2006 and 2012, the fifth and most recent CORINE Land Cover (CLC) inventory was made in 2018. CLC data is collected by optical satellites and provides information on the biophysical characteristics of the Earth’s surface in 44 classes at a resolution of 25 Ha. Despite limitations in spatial resolution, CLC has become the primary spatial data source on land cover at European level. It is widely used for indicator development, environmental modelling and land cover/land use change analysis.\nIn EGMS, the different land-cover classes presented by the CORINE database are used to check and compare for consistency the InSAR measurement point densities resulting from the different processing chains of the four different InSAR Processing Entities (IPE) over differing land cover types. For example, urbanised classes will yield more measurement points than rural, but the relative densities between the IPEs must compare, see Figure 27 below:\n\n\n\nFigure 32 InSAR measurement point density vs CORINE landcover classes: Left panel: Distribution of CORINE land cover classes for landmasses in Europe. Right panel: Measurement point density vs CORINE land cover class for a number of representative tracks for a temporal coherence threshold of 0.7. Black dots: Norway, Red dots: Netherlands and Belgium, Magenta dots: Poland and Denmark.\n\n\nFor more information on the CORINE program and resulting land-cover databases that are freely available, please visit the Copernicus Land Monitoring Service website at: https://land.copernicus.eu/paneuropean/corine-land-cover/clc2018\n\n\n8.1.6 Earthquake Catalogue\nThere are limits to the rates of motion that InSAR can reliably measure. The limits are based on the wavelength of the radar signal and the notion of phase ambiguity, i.e., InSAR can only measure the angular phase shift between corresponding signals, and not the number of phase cycles from target to sensor, i.e., the absolute signal path length. For this reason, any rapid or abrupt movements of the Earth’s surface, such as those caused by earthquakes, can cause discontinuities in InSAR measurement. Knowledge as to the spatial and temporal characteristics of such events is therefore useful for accurate InSAR mapping.\nThe availability of an Earthquake catalogue of European events can allow the selection of appropriate processing strategies to deal with such anomalies. In particular, the processing and quality parameters could be adapted in areas subject to strong earthquakes, in order to retrieve larger displacements, and to take into account stronger non linearities. It could be possible that in correspondence of the areas mostly affected from the earthquake, where structure and infrastructure collapsed, a limited number of measurement points, due to the loss of temporal coherence, is retrieved. This information will be taken into account during the internal quality checks.\nAn example of earthquake catalogue is the one provided by the United States Geological Survey (USGS) available at: https://earthquake.usgs.gov/earthquakes/search/. To be useful, various threshold parameters need to be set such as magnitude and depth beneath which a quake may not have ruptured the surface or left any residual displacement. For EGMS processing, these parameters are thresholded at a magnitude M=6.0. This value could be modified during the project according to the real effects an earthquake and the results of the interferometric processing.\nPerusal of the USGS catalogue shows 38 events that may be relevant to EGMS processing, i.e. that have occurred during the epochs chosen for processing such as the baseline covering February 2015 to December 2020. A map of these events and sample table is shown below\nTable 9 Example listing of some of the 38 earthquake events of relevance to EGMS (in magnitude order).

    "text": "8.2 Trade-offs for Wide Area Processing\nDifferent IPEs use different strategies to select the maximum coverage/data-volume for each of their individual InSAR processes that are then mosaicked. Each approach needs to respect the algorithmic and architectural characteristics at the core of each different processing chain. The results, however, are homogeneous, and the different strategies do not affect the spectral or spatial resolution of the data (e.g., the maximum spatial scale at which deformation phenomena are identified).\nAs explained in Section 3.6, EGMS maps are made from individual, smaller InSAR maps mosaicked together to form the Basic (L2a) product, and further enhanced by anchoring to a GNSS model at a continental scale for the Calibrated (L2b) product. The InSAR measurements are therefore only accountable for phenomena at a spatial scale that are less than half the frequency of the GNSS model. Any phenomena that are larger (e.g., low-frequency tectonic displacements) are added back using GNSS data."

Although the acquisition dates differ, the temporal window covered by the two datasets is similar, thus allowing InSAR specialists at the four IPEs to run internal crosscheck procedures.\nSince the measurement points identified in different data-stacks are, in general, different, the comparison is carried out on a set of “Pseudo-PS” (see Figure below).\n\n\n\nFigure 34 Example of grid of Pseudo-PS and two sets of measurement points coming from two InSAR data-stacks.\n\n\nThe area of interest is divided into small patches of terrain (100 m x 100 m wide), all measurement points belonging to the same patch (usually referred to as Pseudo-PS) and to the same acquisition geometry are averaged and, for each pseudo-PS, results from overlapping tracks are compared.\nTo make a Europe-wide, homogenous InSAR map requires rigorous quality control at the borders of processing to ensure accurate edge-matching.

These data lack a robust quality control, plus the time series for a significant number of measurements are quite short.\nAlternative source: EUDV: Based on EUREF’s Working Group on European Dense Velocities. These data are used as a supplement to EPND and NGL in areas with sparse coverage. However, homogenisation is not performed, and time series data are not provided. Although not a complete solution, EUDV data are useful as auxiliary information for generation of the A-EPND grid in areas where no reliable GNSS information from other sources are available, e.g., Switzerland."

    "text": "9.2 Calibration process\nGNSS and SAR systems show great complementarity, as they perform best at different but contiguous spatial scales. SAR easily retrieves deformation patterns at a few tens of kilometres scale, while GNSS is capable of capturing very slow and regional-scale displacements. The characteristics of the two systems explain why the calibration of SAR results using GNSS modelling is quite a common task, which allows to “hook” SAR local deformation phenomena to an absolute reference system.\nThe Calibrated product is obtained referencing the Basic product to the ETRF2000 frame, by calibration of its lower-frequency phase trends using the EPND model.\n\n\n\nFigure 35 (a) A part of the EPND model on a regular grid used for data calibration. (b) Interpolation of all the deformation components (N, E, Up) of the regular grid GNSS model at the location of each MP. (c) The GNSS retrieved deformation signal is projected on to the InSAR line-of-sight, for both ascending and descending geometries. The image is a qualitative graphic representation for demonstration purposes only.\n\n\nThe calibration process is described in Figure 36.\n\n\n\nFigure 36 L2b products calibration process.\n\n\nGNSS Model interpolation\nThe first step to be performed is the interpolation of all the deformation components (N, E, Up) of the regular grid GNSS model at the location of each MP, both for ascending and descending geometries, as in Figure 35, part (b). Since the EPND model show evident low-pass characteristics, simple linear interpolation operators can be safely applied, without introducing artifacts and maintaining consistency.\nInterpolated Model Projection\nTo achieve consistency, the GNSS model interpolated components have to be projected onto the SAR line of sight at the specific location of each MP, both for ascending and descending geometries, as in Figure 35, part (c). The projection cosines have to be estimated at each MP position, since even small changes in the viewing angle can negatively impact on the result.\nSAR/GNSS Referencing\nThe interpolated and projected GNSS deformation field is subtracted to the SAR deformation field at the location of each MP. The resulting difference, containing the low frequency tectonic components, is modeled with a low-pass surface.\nCompensation\nThe obtained low-pass surface is then subtracted to all the MPs time series. Basically, using the resulting residual displacements, the movement of the InSAR reference point is then re-estimated to fix it to the GNSS reference frame thereby producing the Calibrated (L2b) product.\nReferences\n\nFarolfi, G., Bianchini, S., & Casagli, N.

In practice, this means that the horizontal component of the Ortho product would be restricted to displacements in just east-west directions. In EGMS, the components of the north-south displacement are retrieved from the GNSS dataset, projected on the SAR LOS, and compensated in the L2b products before the InSAR estimation of the vertical and east-west components. A graphical representation of the process can be found in Figure 36.\nThe Ortho product will represent a completely new and unique geospatial dataset of absolute displacement measurements, anchored to a common GNSS framework.\nReferences\n\nHermann Peifer (2011), About the EEA reference grid – available on the web."

The reader can refer to Figure 36.\nAscending and descending Calibrated data are then averaged on to a common 100x100 m grid.\n\n\n\nFigure 39: MPs from ascending and descending orbits are grouped together according to a 100x100 m common grid.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 40: Ascending and descending MPs grouped within each grid-cell are separately averaged, with the result referenced to the centre of the cell.\n\n\nAll ascending and descending measurement point time series within each cell are then separately averaged, with the resulting time series referenced to the centre of the cell. For ‘distributed scatterer’ points, the time series are referenced to the centre of the effective area.\nRejecting grid-cells with less than a predefined number of points will ensure the level of precision required for Ortho (L3) products.\n\n\n\nFigure 41: To maintain reliability, decomposition is performed just on cells which contains a minimum number of MPs in both the ascending and descending orbits.\n\n\nFor each grid-cell containing valid data, i.e., at least one ascending and one descending measurement point, the averaged time series are interpolated to a common six-day sampling. In areas with a significant number of missing observations due to e.g., seasonal snow cover, the shortest of the available time series is used to avoid extrapolation.\nFinally, the vertical and east-west displacement components for each temporal sample is estimated, assuming zero displacement in the North-South direction.\nThe equations used for deriving the east-west and vertical components are weighted according to the estimated accuracy of the input measurements. The error on the output is retrieved using error propagation rules."

The quality check has a binary outcome: Either the TS is updated till the end of 2021, or the MP is removed.\n\nDisplacement values of the TS till the end of 2020 are frozen to the previous/original values, and samples from 2020 to 2021 are added.

Also, only administrator can view and edit any ingestion and extraction within the system to support users if they need any help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT security 4:\nLogging warnings and errors\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe IT solution must log all errors, warnings and events with audit relevance from every component to a file based storage\n\n\nWhy:\nIn order to inspect system events and detect potential security incidents is crucial for maintaining the system integrity and resilience. Log information must not be revealed to the user, but must be stored internally.\n\n\nConsequence:\nAll components of an IT solution must log audit, error and warning information coming from executing the code of the solution\n\n\nExample:\nA user logs in to an application, trying to download a large dataset for processing in the application, the system encounters some fatal errors with the download.

The source code shall include Docker recipes and scripts for building the source code and be published under the EUPL-1.2 license\n\n\nExample:\nSource code of all the components of the specific IT solution must be delivered. Any updates or developments of the source code shall be reflected in the EEA GitHub repository, which is the main repository of the system. Moreover, the specific client IT solutions shall be published under the EUPL-1.2 license, so the openness and transparency are ensured\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency 2:\nInline documentation of the source code\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nSource code of client specific IT solution must be documented in-line\n\n\nWhy:\nTo effectuate the handover from one developer to the next inline documentation are to be included to guide the developer on the job\n\n\nConsequence:\nSource code must have inline documentation. Inline code should be formatted so that it may be easily extracted to generate online documentation\n\n\nExample:\nSource code of all the components of the IT solution must have inline documentation. The documentation shall be structured, following common conventions, and kept at a minimal, but comprehensive level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency 3:\nCommercial software used in the production must be attainable by the EEA or a third-party provider\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nCommercial software which are prerequisites must be attainable on comparable terms. Such software is justified only if no open alternative exists\n\n\nWhy:\nTo ensure that further work may be carried out any prerequisites in the form of software must be attainable by the EEA or a supplier\n\n\nConsequence:\nGenerally attainable commercial software used in production must be listed when delivering an IT solution. Name of software, version, EOL and EOS to be supplied\n\n\nExample:\nAn IT solution is deploying various components and the set-up of the virtual machines that houses the components is done by means of an infrastructure as-a-code-tool. All the capabilities of the infrastructure as-a-code-tool, that require purchasing must be listed when delivering the IT solution"

Also, only administrator can view and edit any ingestion and extraction within the system to support users if they need any help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT security 4:\nLogging warnings and errors\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe IT solution must log all errors, warnings and events with audit relevance from every component to a file based storage\n\n\nWhy:\nIn order to inspect system events and detect potential security incidents is crucial for maintaining the system integrity and resilience. Log information must not be revealed to the user, but must be stored internally.\n\n\nConsequence:\nAll components of an IT solution must log audit, error and warning information coming from executing the code of the solution\n\n\nExample:\nA user logs in to an application, trying to download a large dataset for processing in the application, the system encounters some fatal errors with the download.

    "text": "5.1 Line Breaks and New Lines\nIn Markdown, how you break a line can affect how your text is displayed in the final document. Quarto follows standard Markdown behavior, so it’s important to understand the difference between soft and hard line breaks.\n\n5.1.1 Soft Line Break (Just Pressing Enter)\nWhen you press Enter once and start a new line in your text editor, Markdown does not create a visible line break in the output. Instead, it treats the two lines as part of the same paragraph.\nExample (input):\nThis is the first line\nand this is the second line.\nRendered output:\n    This is the first line and this is the second line.\nThis keeps your Markdown source tidy, but it won’t create new lines unless explicitly instructed\n\n\n5.1.2 Hard Line Break (Using  at End of Line)\nTo force a visible line break in Markdown, you must add two spaces at the end of a line or use a backslash \\. Quarto supports both, but using \\ is clearer and more explicit.\nThis is the first line.\\\nand this is the second line.\nRendered output:\n    This is the first line.\n    and this is the second line.\n\n\n5.1.3 Paragraph Break (Double Enter)\nIf you press Enter twice (i.e., leave a blank line between two lines), Markdown will treat the content as two separate paragraphs. This results in a larger vertical space between the lines in the rendered output.\nExample (input):\nThis is the first paragraph.\n\nThis is the second paragraph.\nRendered output:\n    This is the first paragraph.\n    This is the second paragraph.\nThis behavior is especially important when structuring readable documentation, separating ideas, or organizing content clearly.\n\n\n5.1.4 Summary\n\nUse Enter for a new line in your editor, but don’t expect a visible line break.\nUse \\ at the end of a line when you want to force a line break.\nUse double Enter (i.e., an empty line between paragraphs) to start a new paragraph with extra spacing."

The following approaches work well in both HTML and DOCX outputs, including when converting to PDF.\n\n\n5.10.1 Without Captions\nYou can use a Markdown table to arrange images in multiple columns and rows:\n| ![](image1.png){width=120} | ![](image2.png){width=120} | ![](image3.png){width=120} |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| ![](image4.png){width=120} | ![](image5.png){width=120} | ![](image6.png){width=120} |\nThis creates two rows with three images each. Adjust the width as needed to fit your layout.\n\n\n\n5.10.2 With Captions\nTo add captions under each image, simply include a row of text below each row of images:\n| ![](img1.png){width=120} | ![](img2.png){width=120} | ![](img3.png){width=120} |\n|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|\n| Caption 1               | Caption 2               | Caption 3               |\n| ![](img4.png){width=120} | ![](img5.png){width=120} | ![](img6.png){width=120} |\n| Caption 4               | Caption 5               | Caption 6               |\nThis method keeps captions aligned with each image, and works across all output formats.\n\n⚠️ Note: Tables used for captions will show borders in DOCX and PDF outputs.

Quarto will automatically apply its default rendering format, which is sufficient in most cases.\nHowever, if you need to customize the rendering outputs (e.g. to apply a specific DOCX style), then you must define the format: field carefully.\nThese fields are required for correct rendering:\n\nformat: controls how your document is rendered (HTML, styled DOCX, PDF)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\nYou must include the pdf: default format in the YAML header.\nAlthough PDF is not rendered directly during this step, defining it here ensures compatibility with the automated rendering workflow later. Details are explained in the Rendering Documentation section.\n\n\nIf you override the format section, please follow these strict guidelines:\n\nOnly modify the format: block.\nYou must define all three output formats:\n\nhtml:\ndocx: (with reference-doc: pointing to the style template)\npdf:\n\n\nImproper modifications can break the rendering process locally or in the central Technical Library. To see correct examples of a fully-defined format block, refer to the template files in DOCS/templates/.\nHere’s a basic header you can use:\n---\ntitle: \"Product SHORT NAME\"\nsubtitle: \"Product full name\"\ndate: \"2022-10-06\"\nversion: 1.0\ntemplate-version: 1.0.0\nproduct-name: Product Name\ndescription: \"Product DESCRIPTION\"\n---\n\n6.3.1 Field Descriptions:\n\ntitle: The main title of the document (displayed in the rendered output).\nsubtitle: An optional second line of text under the title.\ndate: The publication or last updated date.\nversion: The version of your document (e.g. “1.0”, “v2.3-draft”).\ntemplate-version: Not rendered — this is a special internal field that helps keep track of which template was originally used. Do not remove or modify this field unless you’re updating the template version intentionally.\n\n\nThese fields must be filled in by the user. Only other fields — such as shared configuration or output format — are pre-filled in the template."

Instead, the process involves a few automatic steps:\n\nQuarto first generates a .docx (Word) file using the styles and settings defined in the YAML header and shared config files.\nThen, a LibreOffice macro automatically converts the .docx to .pdf. \nThe resulting PDF file is saved in the output location.\n\nThis approach ensures consistent and well-formatted PDFs, even across different systems.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nImportant\n\n\n\n\nMake sure pdf: default is included in your YAML header — this triggers the PDF pipeline.\nDo not define custom pdf: options unless you know what you’re doing. \n\n\n\n\n13.2.1 Preview with DOCX Instead of PDF\nInstead of manually generating a PDF (which involves running scripts or waiting for the automated conversion), you can simply render a .docx file. It will look almost exactly like the final PDF because it uses the same styles and layout rules.\nThis is a great option when you want to quickly check how your document will look in PDF format — especially while you’re still editing the .qmd file.\nYou don’t need to change the order of output formats in the YAML header. Just click the black arrow next to the Render button in RStudio and select “Render MS Word” from the dropdown menu.\n\nAfter rendering, the .docx file will automatically open in your default DOCX editor (e.g., Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer). If it doesn’t open automatically, you can still find it saved in the same folder as your .qmd file, with the same base filename.\nThis approach is fast and avoids editing the YAML just to preview layout changes."

    "text": "13.3 Output Location\nWhen you render a single .qmd file locally (e.g. using RStudio or the command line), the output (HTML or DOCX/PDF) is saved next to your source file — usually inside the products/ folder.\nIf you run the full command:\n$ quarto render\nthen Quarto will build the entire Technical Library and save the results in a special _site folder. However, this is typically handled automatically by the rendering workflow in the GitHub repository during the publishing process.\n\n💡 You do not need to render the entire library yourself. Just focus on rendering the file you are currently working on. This keeps things faster and easier to manage during editing.\n\n\n\n13.3.1 About the _quarto.yaml File\nThe _quarto.yaml file is a special configuration file that defines project-wide settings, including the default output folder — which is _site.\nWhen this file is present in the root of your project, RStudio (and Quarto) assumes you’re working in project mode. That means it tries to render the entire site, not just the file you’re editing.\nThis can cause a few issues during local editing:\n\nSlower preview performance\nRStudio sometimes doesn’t pick up the latest changes right away (likely due to caching)\nViewer pane might not display fresh output\n\nUnfortunately, this behavior isn’t clearly documented — but it can be confusing and frustrating.\n\n\n13.3.2 Recommended Setup for Efficient Editing\nTo avoid these issues, the repository includes a renamed config file: _quarto-not-used.yaml. This allows users to edit and preview individual files efficiently without triggering full-site rendering.\nBy default, this means:\n\nRStudio operates in “single file mode”\nOutput files (HTML, DOCX) are written directly next to the .qmd file (e.g. in products/)\n\n\n\n13.3.3 Rendering the Full Project\nWhen you need to preview or build the entire Technical Library locally:\n\nRename _quarto-not-used.yaml to _quarto.yaml\nRun:\n\n$ quarto render\nThis builds the full site into the _site/ folder as defined in the YAML config.\n\n⚠️ Working with _quarto.yaml in place during regular editing can work, but it may lead to slower performance or outdated previews in the Viewer pane. For a smoother editing experience, keep it renamed by default."

The use of ancillary data is recommended.\nInterpreters must be aware that not every change visible on the images should be treated as changes, e.g.:\n\ntransient phenomena such as floods and temporary water-logging;\nseasonal changes in natural vegetation;\nseasonal changes in agriculture, such as effects of crop rotation on arable land;\nforest plantation growth, still not reaching the height and/or canopy closure of forest;\nchanges of water level;\ntemporal changes in water cover of fishpond cassettes being part of their management;\nseasonal changes of snow spots in high mountains.\n…\n\nThe introduction of false changes must also be avoided. Many of these can and should be excluded by pure logics. These vary from country to country (e.g. while normally sea water does not change into pasture, it might happen in the Netherlands), thus following examples are not exhaustive and not binding for all cases. However, in most cases they can be considered valid.\nHighly improbable changes are for example (not a complete list):\n\nClasses 1.1.1 Urban fabric (predominantly public and private units) 🡪 any other class than urban: urban areas seldom disappear.\nClasses 5 Heathland and scrub 🡪 3.x.1.0: bushy vegetation classes of different climatic zones do not change between each other.\n8.1.2 Highly modified natural water courses 🡪 any other class: highly modified natural water courses and canals do not change to another class.\netc.\n\nMinimum Mapping Unit and Minimum Mapping Width for changes\nThe Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) for LCC was set to ≥0.5 ha.\nThe Minimum Mapping Width (MMW) of ≥10 m is also valid for the LCC polygons.\nExceptions from MMU are defined where a generalization of change objects &lt; 0.5 ha is not reasonable because it would discard valuable information:\n\nSimple Change: Changes located at the border of a CZ AoI that continue outside, forming together objects of ≥ 0.5 ha. Those polygons will have the common attribute that is given for objects cut by CZ border. Objects &lt; 0.05 ha will be generalized.\nComplex Change: When a LCC polygon ≥ 0.5 ha is formed by several polygons, also polygons &lt; 0.5 ha have to be considered. See also 0. Complex changes. As the minimum mapping size for single change polygons of complex changes 0.05 ha is proposed.\nSingle changes &lt; 0.05 ha will be generalized.\n\nLand Cover Changes are changes that occur between the timespan 2012 (+/- 2 years) and the timespan 2018 (+/- 1 year). Changes resulting from different interpretations of the same subject are not considered as change.\nDirect delineation of changes\nChange polygons are drawn directly over the corresponding image by visual interpretation and are not generated automatically by a GIS operation."

    "text": "5.3 V.III Complex changes\nAlthough the MMU for change mapping is 0.5 ha, in some cases change polygons &lt; 0.5 ha are also mapped. When a new polygon is formed by taking area from several other polygons (e.g. a road construction, urban growth, …), the individually connected change parts can be mapped even if they are &lt; 0.5 ha, given they altogether make up a ≥ 0.5 ha complex change polygon (shown in Figure 2).\nThe minimum mapping unit for single polygons of complex changes is: ≥ 0.05 ha\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Urban expansion: Changes with MMU &lt; 0.5 ha make up a complex change area of 0.5 ha.\n\n\nExplanation of shown figure: In 2018 urban area (1.1.1.1) has taken 0.1 ha from managed grassland (4.1) and 0.4 ha from arable land (2.1.1). That means in 2018 we have one single class and in 2012 two different classes &lt;0.5ha. These two changes make up a complex change area of 0.5 ha.\nComplex changes have to have a common attribute (“splitted change”) in 2012 and in 2018 and must make up altogether ≥ 0.5 ha.\nEvery mapped complex change should result in a correct status mapping of 2012 and 2018. The derived status maps need to fulfil the mapping specifications, especially the Minimum Mapping Unit of 0.5 ha. If all polygons are dissolved by their 2012 level 5 code no object should have an area &lt;0.5 ha (the same applies for 2018 respectively). If this can't be guaranteed the single change parts need to be generalized.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: Urban expansion: Changes with MMU &lt; 0.5 ha make up a complex change area of 0.5 ha, but because the single changes would result in an incorrect status map 2018 they are generalized to one class.\n\n\n\n5.3.1 V.III.II Handling changes in, by-definition, change classes — changes at landscape level\nCZ nomenclature includes some land cover classes that, by definition, are characterized by a land cover change. These classes are:\n\n1.3.1.1 Mineral extraction sites\n1.3.1.2 Dump sites\n1.3.1.3 Construction sites\n1.3.2 Land without current use\n3.4 Transitional woodland and scrub\n\nIf a construction site in 2012 is visible, a new construction, mainly urban, is likely to be visible in 2018 as well. If a construction site in 2018 is visible, another former land use, is likely to be visible in 2012.\nTransitional woodland indicates that a regrowth of forest should appear from 2012 to 2018 or deforestation between 2012 and 2018 (exception possible)."

    "text": "3.1 Base Vegetation Layer\nThe Base Vegetation Layer (BVL) is an internal processing layer to ensure better base consistency between the VLCC product groups Croplands, Grasslands and Tree Cover & Forests. The BVL provides a gap-free yearly mapping of the areas with tree cover and cropland and/or grassland. It also classifies a background class which comprises non-vegetated areas (e.g. bare ground, urban areas, water), lichens and mosses as well as shrubs (as long as not for agriculture such as vineyards). This section details the applied methods for the production of the BVL. An overview of the workflow is provided in Figure 1.\n\n\n\nFigure 1: High-level flow chart of the BVL workflow and its usage by the downstream processors for Tree Cover & Forests, Grasslands and Croplands.\n\n\n\n3.1.1 Input data\nThe main input data sources for the BVL are Sentinel-2 time-series covering the period for a respective reference years ± 3 months (e.g. for 2018 observations from 2016-10-01 till 2019-03-31 are considered). Initially the Scene Classification Layers (SCL) for all available S-2 L2A products and with a cloud coverage lower than 80% are retrieved and a time-series is constructed using the best (i.e. lowest cloud cover) scenes within a given spatio-temporal window. Typically,windows of 15 days and 20x20km are used, for parts of Scandinavia this has been augmented to 5 days and 10x10km to reduce the impact of frequent cloud cover.\nThe training / validation and test data required for the model calibration are compiled from various sources, such as from adjusted and filtered LUCAS (Eurostat, 2018) data of 2018, from stratified automated land cover (LC) class annotations based on existing land use/land cover maps, such as the CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2018 and HRL Imperviousness 2018. Those are complemented with additional visual sample point photo-interpretation from Very High Resolution (VHR) imagery, Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) time series and auxiliary datasets.\nThe initial training dataset comprises approximately 1.1 Million training points which are subjected to routines for detecting tree cover losses (based on NDVI time-series) as well as erroneous annotations and outliers related to general land cover changes (Cleanlab, Northcutt et al., 2021). Additional sampling is performed during the production on an ad hoc basis for particularly difficult areas.\n\n\n3.1.2 Annual classification\nGiven the heterogeneity of the addressed European landscapes, all classifier training, testing and, finally, LC classification, is performed along substrata based on biogeographical regions (Metzger et al. 2013) and existing LC layers. The AOI is subdivided in 232 of these substrata which form the Production Units (PUs) (Figure 2). The goal of this stratification is to facilitate the fitting of the models to the regional specificities and thereby achieve a higher accuracy. The model architecture is a Temporal Convolutional Neural Network (TempCNN, Pelletier et al. 2019) which is trained with labels and filtered time-series (see section Input Data) of five reference years in the respective PU and a buffer area of 10km. Inference is performed on yearly time-series for the target reference year ± 3 months and outputs yearly probabilities for the 6 basic land cover classes:\n\nherbaceous vegetation;\ntree cover-broadleaved;\ntree cover-coniferous\ncropland;\ntree crops (i.e. nomenclature overlap between broadleaved tree cover and permanent crops in the HRL Croplands product);\nbackground class (including bare and sparsely vegetated areas and non-agricultural shrubs);\n\nIn a subsequent post-processing step two further classes are derived to delineate the:\n\npotential overlap herbaceous – cropland (i.e. pixels which are classified as cropland and herbaceous at least once in the time-series);\nThe second derived class is derived from the intersection of all areas classified as tree cover and a preliminary version of the Tree Cover Density to delineate areas with low Tree Cover Density and hence allowed overlaps of herbaceous and tree cover.\n\nThe resulting Base Vegetation Layer is derived annually considering a time-window of five years (e.g. 2017 – 2021) to delineate the boundaries between grassland, cropland, tree cover and other land cover types (e.g. built-up areas, sealed areas, water, bare ground, permanent snow/ice, non-agricultural shrubs) not relevant for further processing steps within the HRL VLCC.\n\n\n\nFigure 2: Production units subdividing the EEA-38 area into homogenous biogeographical substrata for the production of the BVL (GF: French Guiana, GP: Guadeloupe, MQ: Martinique, RE: Le Réunion, YT: Mayotte).\n\n\n\n\n3.1.3 Post-classification processing\nA sequence of post-processing steps is applied to improve the spatial and temporal consistency of the products. Spatial filtering aims to reduce salt and pepper noise and temporal filtering reduces frequent and implausible land cover changes (often along the class boundaries). The designation of overlap classes accounts for known overlaps in the nomenclatures and aims to minimize the inheritance of omission errors in the extent of herbaceous and cropland areas for further Grasslands and Croplands products.\nAn initial post-processing step involves applying bilateral filtering of the probabilities to reduce noise while preserving sharp spatial edges between land cover classes (Schindler 2012). This filtering is performed prior to rule-based harmonisation, ensuring that downstream products maintain spatially consistent classifications while avoiding excessive blurring at class boundaries and preserving ecologically meaningful edges. Subsequently the probabilities from any newly produced PU are blended with the readily available neighbouring PUs in an 10km overlap buffer. Within this buffer area the probabilities of all relevant PUs are averaged; the distance to the PU borders are used as a weight for the averaging to ensure seamless classification results.\nIn a further step change detection is performed to identify potential tree cover changes. To this end, the sum of the probabilities for tree cover (tree cover-broadleaved; tree cover-coniferous, tree crops) are considered; the difference of the sums is computed between the reference year at the intervals of the 3-yearly change layers (2018-2021-2024). Changes from a tree cover class to a non-tree cover class are allowed in the time-series if the difference of the tree cover probabilities exceed a certain threshold (see Section 3.2 for further details). Tree cover changes that do not exceed the thresholds are harmonized in the time-series to the class with the highest mean probability across a time-window of five years.\nFinally, a rule-based postprocessing is applied to harmonize the 5-year classification, identify areas with potential overlaps among the different HRL VLCC products, and generate the final BVLs. Detected changes tree-cover changes are not modified by the rule-based processing.\nThe rules summarized in Table 1 are processed hierarchically so that latter rules overwrite the result of a previous rule for the same pixel:\nTable 1: Overview of post-processing rules for the derivation of the harmonized annual BVLs.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nRule #\nRule\nPurpose\n\n\n\n\n1.\nFive-year temporal sequences of herbaceous vegetation and the background class are recoded to sequences of herbaceous vegetation only.\nReduction of potential omission of herbaceous vegetation, especially in areas with dry grasslands.\n\n\n2.\nFive-year temporal sequences of cropland and the background class are recoded to sequences of cropland only.\nAvoid omission of temporarily fallow land from cropland processing extent.\n\n\n3.\nFive-year temporal sequences of cropland and herbaceous vegetation are recoded to class 7overlap herbaceous – cropland.\nReduce propagation of uncertainties in BVL classification for downstream processing of croplands and grasslands.\n\n\n4.\nAny pixel with co-occurrence of tree cover and Tree Cover Density &lt;=10% in any of the last five reference years is assigned to class 6 overlaps of herbaceous and tree cover.\nAccount for the overlap of the definitions of the HRL Tree Cover & Forests and HRL Grassland layer.\n\n\n\nThose processing rules result into two further potential overlap classes being identified:\n\noverlap herbaceous – cropland\noverlaps of herbaceous and tree cover\n\nPixels with overlap herbaceous – cropland are then subject to further processing by both the Cropland and the Grassland processor. Specifically, pixels initially labelled as Fodder Crops in a preliminary version of the Crop Type (CTY) product are removed from the CTY product and now assigned to the Herbaceous (HER) layer.\nAreas identified as overlaps of herbaceous and tree cover can be designated as both herbaceous and tree cover by the Grassland and Tree Cover & Forest processors, respectively. Similarly, areas identified as overlaps between crop and tree cover (i.e. tree crops) can appear in both the Cropland products and the Tree Cover & Forest products."

    "text": "3.2 HRL Tree Cover & Forests\nThe HRL Tree Cover & Forests products comprise several annual status and 3-yearly change layers which are partially derived from the outputs of the BVL classification and combined with separate processing chain to estimate Tree Cover Density. This section details the applied methods for the production of the Tree Cover & Forests products. An overview of the workflow is provided in Figure 3.\n\n\n\nFigure 3: High-level flow chart of the production workflow for the Tree Cover & Forests products TCD, DLT, TCPC and DLTC.\n\n\nDominant Leaf Type (DLT), Tree Cover Presence Change (TCPC) and Dominant Leaf Type Change (DLTC)\nThe BVL classification provides annual probabilities for coniferous trees, broadleaved trees and tree crops (e.g. fruit and olive trees). These probabilities serve as inputs for generating several forest-related products:\n\nYearly Dominant Leaf Type (DLT)\nYearly Tree Cover Presence Change (TCPC)\nYearly Dominant Leaf Type Change (DLTC)\n\nThe derivation process begins with the detection of tree cover losses and gains based on the sum of the probabilities for tree cover (tree cover-broadleaved; tree cover-coniferous, tree crops). The difference of the sums of these probabilities is computed between the reference years at the intervals t1 and t2 of the 3-yearly change layers (e.g. between 2018 and 2021). Regionally calibrated thresholds are then applied to these probability differences whereas:\n\nNegative probability differences below the threshold are assigned as tree cover loss\nPositive probability differences above the threshold are assigned as tree cover gain\n\nVice-versa all probability changes that do not exceed the thresholds are discarded. For these rejected changes the most probable class across the 5-year period is assigned instead. Both accepted and rejected changes are then propagated back into the annual DLT and BVL layers to ensure consistency. Accepted changes are propagated to the time-step which has the highest difference in the time-series.\nFor example: The probability difference over three years (e.g. 2018-2021) for tree loss is -60% and below a defined threshold of -45%. The change is accepted. In the three annual time steps (e.g. 2018-2019, 2019-2020, 2020-2021) the probability differences are -20%, +10%, -50%. In this case the change is allocated in the last time-step of the annual status layers.\nFrom this process an initial change pixel-based 3-annual change mask is obtained. This mask is aggregated to 20m resolution using the aggregation rules detailed in Annex I. To derive Tree Cover Presence Change (TCPC) a Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) filter is applied (see Annex II for details) to:\n\nEliminate change patches smaller than 1 hectare\nFill small gaps within valid change patches\n\nFor the derivation of the Dominant Leaf Type Change (DLTC) the first step is the computation of a pixel-wise differences of the DLTs at t1 and t2 and its subsequent aggregation to 20m using the aggregation rules defined in Annex I. This raw version of the DLTC is subsequently masked and harmonized with the TCPC. For patches filled during the MMU filtering of the TCPC the leaf type information is complemented based on the majority of the surroundings in the raw DLTC to assure full consistency between TCPC and DLTC.\n\n3.2.1 Tree Cover Density (TCD)\nFor the annual Tree Cover Density (TCD) layer (starting with the reference year 2018), the median spectral values of Sentinel-2 bands (B02, B03, B04, B08, B11 and B12) are computed for the vegetation season of each reference year. In areas, affected by persistent snow or heavy cloud cover alternative percentiles of the respective bands are used to minimize potential artefacts in the product. These spectral inputs are complemented by the mean classification probabilities for coniferous trees, broadleaved trees and tree crops resulting from the BVL classification.\nTo train the model, reference samples are drawn from the previous version of HRL TCD 2018 using a stratified sampling approach over areas with stable tree cover across all 5 reference years. A CatBoost regression model (Dorogush et al. 2018) is then trained with these yearly input data for the respective production unit and used to estimate the TCD for each reference year over the full extent of the PU. The model calibration involves a grid-search during which different degrees of oversampling of lower and highest TCD value ranges are tested. The aim of this gridsearch is to reduce the underestimation of these values ranges in the final layer.\nIn a subsequent post-processing step, the yearly TCD are harmonised by applying a histogram matching technique (Coltuc et al. 2006) and an additional smoothing step to limit sudden implausible spikes in the TCD over time. Lastly, the DLT classification is applied on top of the TCD to mask out non-tree covered areas, ensuring the final product reflects only valid tree cover.\nA series of further layers is derived from the TCD, DLT as well of other ancillary datasets. An overview of the dependencies of these derived products is provided in Figure 4 and detailed in the following paragraphs.\n\n\n3.2.2 Forest Additional Support Layer (FADSL)\nThe Forest Additional Support Layer (FADSL) at 10m spatial resolution is used to separate real “forest” areas from non-forest areas (i.e. trees predominantly used for agricultural practices, trees in urban context) in order to derive a Forest Type product which is largely following the FAO definition. The respective areas are derived through a rule-based spatial intersection of the 10m DLT and TCD layers with CLC 2018 and IMD 2018.\n\nGeneration of a binary mask with\n\n\n\n0: non-impervious: HRL IMD == 0\n1: impervious: HRL IMD &gt; 0\n\n\nFiltering of all contiguous all non-impervious patches &lt; 25 ha which are fully surrounded by impervious areas in a 4-pixel connectivity mode and subsequently reclassification to 1 = all impervious areas.\nHierarchical intersection of the DLT (with TCD ranging from 10-100%), CLC 2018 (vector geometries rasterized at 10m spatial resolution) and the gap-filled imperviousness dataset as detailed in Table 2 .\n\nTable 2 FADSL - hierarchical intersection of input layers and resulting thematic classes\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nOrder\nDLT Class\nCLCClass\nIMDClass\nFADSLClass\nClass Description\n\n\n\n\n1.)\n1 or 2\nany\n1\n4\ntrees in urban context – broadleaved and coniferous (from HRL Imperviousness context)\n\n\n2.)\n1 or 2\n141\n0\n5\ntrees in urban context – broadleaved and coniferous (from CLC class 1.4.1)\n\n\n3.)\n1\n222or223\nany\n3\ntrees predominantly used for agricultural practices – broadleaved (from CLC classes 2.2.2 and 2.2.3)\n\n\n\n255\nany\nany\n255\noutside area (predefined through boundary layer)\n\n\n\nany other remaining combination\nany other remaining combination\nany other remaining combination\n0\nall non-tree areas, and tree cover without urban context or agricultural use\n\n\n\nIt is worth mentioning that the derived delineation of non-forest tree cover areas has certain limitations due to the specifications and thematic accuracies of the different input data (DLT with density values ranging from 10-100%; CLC 2018 with 25 ha MMU; IMD 2018 also representing infrastructure). This includes the frequency and timelines of updates which imposes the need use input layers that predate the actual reference year of the FTY (e.g. FTY 2021 was produced using still CLC 2018 and the first version of the HRL IMD 2018.\n\n\n\nFigure 4: High-level flow chart of the production workflow for the Tree Cover & Forests products FADSL, FTY and aggregated products at 100m.\n\n\n\n\n3.2.3 Forest Type (FTY)\nThe Forest Type (FTY) layer implements forest maps largely following the definition provided by the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), as specified in the terms and definitions of the Global Forest Resources Assessment (FRA) Working Paper 1 (FAO, 2012). The 10m FTY product is computed by applying the FAO´s definition, however, for EEA-specific purposes, it explicitly includes tree cover in traditional agroforestry systems, such as Dehesa and Montado, which are typically excluded under standard FAO criteria.\nIn a first step an intermediate tree cover mask product is derived through spatial intersection of the two primary status layers TCD (≥ 10-100%) and *DLT, where areas under agricultural use and in urban context as provided by the FADSL are excluded. To ensure consistency with the specified Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU) of 0.5 hectares (equivalent to 50 pixels), the resulting tree cover mask is refined using the GDALSieve1 operation. This operation removes small patches below the MMU and fills in small gaps. The output is used to create an initial version of the Forest Type product, that is still missing information in areas, which were filled and marked as tree cover during the sieving process. Furthermore, an ancillary mask is created by mapping these specific pixels with no data values. The GDALFillNodata2 function is used to assign values to the pixel shown in the ancillary mask by using an inverse distance weighting algorithm to fill NoData areas based on the values of surrounding pixels. In the last formatting step those interpolated areas and the initial Forest Type version are combined to form the final Forest Type product, which is finally aligned to the processing extent as given in the official Boundary Layer (EEA, 2023).\n\n\n3.2.4 Aggregated products - Tree Cover Density (TCD) 100m, Broadleaved Cover Density (BCD) & Coniferous Cover Density (CCD)\nThe TCD at 100m spatial resolution is derived through spatial aggregation from the 10m TCD status layer for the respective reference year. The 100m LAEA grid is used to calculate the arithmetic mean density of all underlying 10m pixels (with density values from 0-100) for each 100m cell. The thereof resulting mean values from the aggregation (floating point data type) are rounded and finally converted to integer values (e.g. raw values in the range from 33.5 to 34.4 are converted to a density value of 34).\nSeveral further layers are derived through operations of intersection and aggregations including Broadleaved Cover Density (BCD) and Coniferous Cover Density (CCD) layers. BCD is the aggregated density of broadleaved trees and shows the percentage of broadleaved pixels in the DLT for the respective reference year while CCD is the aggregated density of coniferous trees and shows the percentage of coniferous pixels. Both BCD and CCD layers are derived through aggregation of the 10m DLT. The 100m LAEA grid is overlaid to the 10m DLT product. Within each 100m cell the number of broadleaved and coniferous pixels are counted and the respective percentages stored into 100m pixel of the CCD and BCD, respectively.\n\n\n3.2.5 Aggregated products - Forest Type (FTY) 100m\nThe FTY at 100m spatial resolution is derived through spatial aggregation from the FTY 10m status layer based on the spatially consistent EEA 100m grid. The first step is to identify forest covered 100m cells by counting and summing up all forest pixels (broadleaved and coniferous) of the 10m FTY product within the respective grid cell. If the number of forest pixels is ≥ 50, the 100m grid cell is assigned to “forest cover”. In case a 100m cell contains less than 50 forest covered 10m pixels, it will be labelled as all non-forest areas in the final product.\nAfter identifying the forest areas, the CORINE Land Cover definition for broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest is applied. The class broadleaved forest is assigned in 100m grid cells, which contain ≥75% forest pixels belonging to broadleaved. If a 100m grid cells consists of ≥ 75% coniferous pixels within the forested area it is assigned to coniferous forest. Areas in which neither “broadleaved” nor “coniferous” constituents account for ≥75% of the 10m forest pixels are labelled as mixed zones.\n\n\n3.2.6 Dominant Leaf Type Confidence Layer (DLTCL)\nThe DLTCL uses the probabilities gained during BVL/DLT computation from the Temporal convolutional neural network to compute classification confidence. The classification confidence is considered here as the probability margin between the highest and second highest ranked leaf type class. The margin is derived by calculating the absolute difference values of probabilities for coniferous and broadleaved tree cover classes. High confidence (up to 100%) indicates domination of one class, whereas lower values (close to 0%) are typical for areas with similar probabilities, suggesting uncertainty or mixed tree cover types.\n\n\n3.2.7 Tree Cover Density Confidence Layer (TCDCL)\nThe TCDCL uses the Total Uncertainty (Variance) metric calculated from CatBoost algorithm to derive the standard deviation for each estimated TCD value. Total uncertainty is the sum of data and knowledge uncertainty. The former can be seen as a measure for data complexity due to noisy data or overlapping classes. Knowledge uncertainty is obtained from a single CatBoost model by using virtual ensembles (Malinin et al. 2020). If this option is enabled during the CatBoost run the one existing model is basically divided into (n) separate models. The annual TCD production was done with ()=10. Based on these 10 models Knowledge uncertainty is computed by the variance of the mean values predicted by all models. Low TCDCL values indicate high confidence in the estimated TCD value.\n\n\n3.2.8 Tree Cover Presence Change Confidence Layer (TCPCCL)\nThe TCPCCL relies as well on the probabilities for coniferous and broadleaved tree cover classes gained during BVL/DLT computation to calculate change confidence. The change confidence here refers to the change in combined tree cover probability from 2018 to 2021. This is done by summing up the probabilities for coniferous and broadleaved tree cover classes for each reference year and afterwards the absolute difference is calculated between 2018 and 2021 respectively. High values signal a big difference between both years and thus a high confidence in change detection, whereas lower values indicate some uncertainty.\n\n\n3.2.9 Encountered issues and known limitations\nOmission of sparse tree cover is commonly known challenge for tree cover mapping since lower canopy cover leads to a mixed reflectance signal that becomes increasingly dominated by the understory. The issue is further aggravated by imperfections of the multi-temporal coregistration of the Sentinel-2 data. Sparse tree cover is common at the timber line but in particular in the Mediterranean comprising agroforestry systems (Dehesas, Montados) and Olive Groves. Initial classifications for the Iberian Peninsula and Southern Italy revealed large areas of Olive Groves and Dehesas which triggered a reprocessing. This included the revision of approximately 7000 additional samples and the collection of around 5500 additional tree cover samples. Retraining the model with the revised sample database indeed provided major improvements. Further enhancements were implemented also in the post-processing to boost tree cover probabilities in areas designated as Agroforestry, Olive Groves and other type of tree cover according to the Corine Land Cover layer for 2018. An example for the status of the DLT before and after the reprocessing is provided in Figure 5. Though the reprocessing has significantly reduced the amount of omission errors, tree cover omission is generally still more pronounced in the Mediterranean region.\n\n\n\nFigure 5: Dominant Leaf Type for the reference year 2021 a) after initial classification and b) after reprocessing for agroforestry system in Andalusia, Spain (LAEA 3044254.4m, 1822153.02m) Background Google Maps VHR imagery 03/2021.\n\n\nThe employed regression-based method for the estimation of the Tree Cover Density is generally sensitive to the propagation of artefacts resulting from cloud cover and topographic effects from the input satellite imagery. The usage of median time features is in most cases robust to such artefacts but some issues have been encountered frequently, not all of which could be fully resolved in the final layers.\nThis concerns topographic effects where cast shadows result in dark features in the imagery and an overestimation of the TCD. Similarly, the topographic correction of the Sentinel-2 L2A processor tends to overestimate reflectance on north and north-west facing slopes which in turn can lead to an underestimation of the TCD. Such topographic effects are typically more pronounced at higher latitudes with lower sun angles. An example is provided in Figure 6.\nUnderestimations and spatial patterns that are not related to actual variations of the canopies can also be caused by cloud cover. On the one hand, this can be caused by clouds that are not detected in the SCL accompanying the Sentinel-2 L2A data. On the other hand, frequent cloudcover during the peak period of the vegetation season can lead to a higher impact of scenes from early spring that may depict broadleaved deciduous tree (especially those with later leaf emergence such as Fagus and Quercus) still with leaf off conditions. A rigorous quality control was conducted to detect such artefacts and adjust parameters for median time-feature computation as much as possible. This included for example the usage of shorter time-windows (starting only in May) or alternative statistical metrics such as 25th- and 75th percentiles. While this enabled to significantly reduced the amount of artefacts as illustrated in Figure 7, it was not possible to fully resolve all cases encountered.\n\n\n\nFigure 6: Example for an area with imprints of topographic effects into the Tree Cover Density layer in Northern Norway (LAEA. 4833337.67m, 5288588.26m) a) VHR image 07/2021 (Google Maps) b) final TCD layer for 2021 and c) median of S-2 L2A band 3 over the vegetation season.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7: Example for initial TCD underestimation due to proportional high number of early spring scenes with trees in leaf-off conditions in Northern Germany (LAEA, 4186992.95m 3368117.83m). a) initial (unmasked) TCD estimates using median features for March – October 2021 and showing severe underestimation for broadleaved deciduous canopies, b) VHR image 2021 and c) final TCD based on reduced time window from May to September 2021 and percentile features."

    "text": "3.3 HRL Grasslands status and change layers\nThis section gives an overview of the methodology employed to produce the layers Herbaceous Cover (HER), Ploughing Indicator (PLOUGH), Grassland (GRA) and Grassland Change (GRAC).\n\n3.3.1 Input data\nAll grassland products described in the following subsections are based on a common set of input and auxiliary data. The main source of information is the Base Vegetation Layer (BVL), specifically the probability associated with the herbaceous class serves as a starting point for subsequent derivations.\nIn addition to the BVL, different sets of auxiliary data are needed:\n\nCorine Land Cover (CLC 2018)3 (to dampen the probability of certain areas)\nCLCplus Backbone 2018 (CLCplus BB)4 (as reference to derive probability thresholds)\nHRL Grassland 20185 (as reference to derive probability thresholds)\nPrevious version of HRL Ploughing Indicator 2018 (to mark ploughing events before availability of S2 data in 2017)\n\n\n\n3.3.2 Herbaceous Cover (HER)\nThe production of the Herbaceous Cover (HER) is primarily based on the probability estimates obtained from the Base Vegetation Layer (BVL) which also serves to harmonise the different vegetated HRL products, including HRL Grasslands, Tree Cover & Forests and Croplands. The BVL is created annually (2017-2021) and using probability estimates of various land cover types.\nTo derive the herbaceous layer, various operations are performed on the probability estimates to either locally increase or decrease the herbaceous probabilities. The Corine Land Cover (CLC) 2018 layer is applied to weight the probabilities for some classes such as peat bogs, sclerophyllous vegetation and others to eliminate false positives from the 2018 reference year classification. To determine the final herbaceous layer, a suitable threshold must be established for each processing unit (i.e. EEA tile). Probabilities above this threshold are considered to be herbaceous. The thresholds are calibrated using additional CLMS products, the previous version of HRL Grassland 2018 and CLC 2018. The BVL herbaceous probabilities are compared with all matching pixels from these layers. This ensures that only pixels are considered where both layers indicate the same land cover type. The threshold is chosen dynamically by finding the probability which maximizes the accuracy between the herbaceous BVL probability and the CLMS products. To avoid a too general (or even constant) threshold for the whole EEA tile, the accuracy is matched in 16 sub-tiles and then interpolated over the whole tile using a Gaussian filter. This process ensures that strong differences in landscape and vegetation within an EEA tile are still addressed.\nTo further tune these HER thresholds a manual inspection using visually interpreted sample points is conducted. In case of strong over- or underestimation the process can be rerun manually forcing the algorithm to use increased or decreased thresholds.\nMoreover, the probabilities between yearly layers are harmonized to reduce rapid changes that are often due to classification noise. This achieved by calculating the (fast) Dynamic Time Warp (DTW) of the time-series of two subsequent years using the Vegetation Phenology and Productivity– Plant Phenology Index (HR-VPP PPI)6 time-series (Salvador et. al. 2007). All yearly binary HER layers are finally determined by applying the threshold found in the procedure described above. Further details follow in the Grassland Change (GRAC) layer section 3.3.6.\nAdditionally, the binary HER layer is enriched with information from the Crop Types (CTY) layer. All pixels classified as fodder crop (class 1500) are included (for each year respectively) in the binary HER layer. Finally, the herbaceous extent is clipped to the yearly BVL.\nThe following steps are needed to derive the herbaceous products:\n\nRetrieve herbaceous probability estimates from BVL herbaceous class.\nFind threshold in reference year by maximizing accuracy when compared to CLMS products\nTune probability estimates\n\nDampen probabilities of selected classes using CLC 2018 to eliminate false positives.\nHarmonize probabilities between yearly layers to reduce rapid changes.\n\nApply threshold to all years to determine binary layers\nMask herbaceous layer\nData outputs (creation of the Cloud-Optimized-GeoTiffs, colortables, metadata)\n\n\n\n3.3.3 Ploughing Indicator (PLOUGH)\nThe PLOUGH indicator is generated by analysing a combination of data sources: a series of binary HER (herbaceous) classification layers, BVL (Base Vegetation Layer) classes, and HR VPP PPI (Plant Phenology Index) quantiles.\n\nBVL classes 4 (crop) and 7 (transition between herbaceous and crop) are used as indicators of a ploughing event.\nLow PPI quantiles signal periods of low vegetation, which may correspond to ploughing activity.\n\nFor reference years before 2017, where data is missing, the system uses ploughing records from the historic PLOUGH (HIS-PLOUGH) product, which can introduce certain inconsistencies (see section 3.3.9).\nThe algorithm works by detecting the first break in a continuous series of HER classifications—a potential sign of ploughing. If such a break is found, it’s labelled as a “possible ploughing event” and is then cross-checked with both the PPI data and BVL classification to confirm if ploughing actually occurred.\n\nIf the break is confirmed, it’s recorded as a ploughing event.\nIf it’s not confirmed, the pixel is either:\n\nReclassified as HER (if the BVL suggests it’s still herbaceous because it’s inside a crop class), or\nAssigned to Class 100, indicating a change in HER cover but not due to ploughing.\n\n\nIf no break is found, the pixel is excluded from the PLOUGH layer but will still be included as grassland in the GRA layer. See Figure 8 for a visualization of the workflow as a flowchart.\nTo reduce salt-and-pepper noise, the final PLOUGH layer is filtered using a minimum mapping unit (MMU) of 0.03 ha (i.e. 3x10m pixels). Since the processing based on 100km tiles, this step includes gathering intermediate version of all neighbouring tiles to avoid edge-effects at the tile borders.\nData outputs include the creation of Cloud-Optimized GeoTIFFs, accompanying colour tables, and detailed metadata.\n\n\n\nFigure 8: Flowchart of the PLOUGH decision logic\n\n\n\n\n3.3.4 Grassland (GRA)\nThe Grassland (GRA) layers are directly derived from the Herbaceous Cover (HER) and Ploughing (PLOUGH) layers. A pixel is considered to be grassland if it has been herbaceous for five consecutive years7. To retrieve this information the corresponding binary HER layer is masked with the corresponding PLOUGH layer, leaving only HER pixels which have not been ploughed in the previous year.\nLike the HER layer, each Grassland layer is clipped to the yearly BVL extent and filtered to a MMU of 0.03 ha. However, only class 1 of the BVL is used to mask the GRA layer (unlike classes 1, 6 and 7 for HER), since overlaying classes 6 and 7 do not allow grassland classifications.\nThe following steps are needed to derive the HRL Grasslands layers:\n\nMask binary Herbaceous Cover (HER) with ploughing indicator to determine grassland layer\nMask Grassland (GRA) layer to yearly BVL (class 1 only)\nApplication of the MMU 0.03 ha (i.e. of 3 x 10m pixels). Since the processing based on 100km tiles, this step includes gathering intermediate version of all neighbouring tiles to avoid edge-effects at the tile borders.\nFinalizing steps (creation of the Cloud-Optimized-GeoTiffs, colortables, metadata)\n\nThe application of the MMU and the finalization steps are performed only after all tiles have been processed to also take border regions of adjacent tiles into account.\n\n\n3.3.5 Grassland Confidence (GRACL)\nThe Grassland Confidence Layer (GRACL) gives an estimate of how confident the classification was in predicting a certain grassland pixel. It is derived as the mean taken over the respective herbaceous confidence values. These are not an actual layer but are still derived in the workflow process. The herbaceous confidence for any year is the difference between an herbaceous probability taken from the BVL and the second highest probability. Therefore, the higher the herbaceous probability is, the greater the difference to the second highest probability and therefore also a higher herbaceous confidence value. In case another probability is higher than the herbaceous probability, the confidence value is set to zero.\nThe grassland confidence is then simply derived as the mean of the relevant herbaceous confidence layers.\nFurthermore, the layer is clipped to actual grassland pixels. Note, that it is possible, even though unlikely, that a grassland pixel can result in having a confidence value of zero, if the mean of all herbaceous confidence values resulted in zero.\n\n\n3.3.6 Grassland Change (GRAC)\nAs described above, the main part of the processing and time-series analysis is carried out in the processing of the herbaceous layer as this builds the fundament of any subsequently derived layer. For the change detection, it is specifically important to include a sophisticated time-series analysis into the herbaceous classification to prevent false class-flips between consecutive years and therefore to avoid artificial changes introduced by classification noise by calculating the (fast) Dynamic Time Warp (DTW) of the time-series of two subsequent years as already described in section Section 3.3.2 In principle, various vegetation indices, such as Normalised Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI), Enhanced Vegetation Index (EVI) or Leave Area Index (LAI), can be utilized to accomplish this objective. However, for ease of use and availability, it was decided to use HR-VPP PPI7 time-series for this analysis.\nDepending on the similarity of the time-series in terms of DTW, the raw herbaceous classification probabilities are adapted according to the following formula:\n\nwith\n\nIn this equation,  and  represent the herbaceous classification probabilities for the two years, while  and  stand for their corresponding vegetation sensitive index time-series, specifically the HR-VPP PPI8 time-series. This approach allows to define two thresholds,  and  which define the level of similarity that must be reached by the two signals to allow or suppress a possible class switch in the Herbaceous Cover (HER). In simple terms, the DTW gives a low value for very similar time series and a high value if the time-series are different. If no change is seen, the classification probability of the previous year is kept. Values in between the two thresholds are linearly interpolated. For the production, the thresholds were set to 0,5 and 1,5, respectively.\nAfter the grassland layers have been processed with the above algorithm, the derivation of the grassland change follows the following steps:\n\nAggregation to 20m by a majority rule (see aggregation rules in Annex II)\nAssignment of the GRAC classes:\n\n0: Non-grassland in both years\n1: Grassland gain\n2: Grassland loss\n10: Grassland in both years\n\nApplication of the MMU of 1.0 ha (i.e. 25 x 20m pixels) for grassland losses and gains by the following steps:\n\nMask creation for losses and gains\nSieving of all classes with the above size threshold. Since the processing based on 100km tiles, this step includes gathering intermediate version of all neighbouring tiles to avoid edge-effects at the tile borders.\n\nApplication of the filtered layer in masked parts\nData output (creation of the Cloud-Optimized-GeoTiffs, colour tables, metadata)\n\nThe application of the MMU and the finalisation steps are performed only after all tiles have been processed to also take border regions of adjacent tiles into account.\n\n\n3.3.7 Grassland Change Confidence Layer (GRACCL)\nThe Grassland Change Confidence Layer (GRACCL) gives an estimate on the confidence for the grassland gains and losses derived in the Grassland Change layer. To derive this confidence value the grassland probability layers from 2018 and 2021 are needed. These are derived by applying the mean to all for the reference year relevant herbaceous layers (e.g. for the 2021 grassland probability the mean over all herbaceous layers from 2017-2021 are used, since all those reference years influence those probabilities.\nThe grassland change confidence value is then derived as\n\nwhere p1 is the grassland probability of the first reference year and p2 is the grassland probability of the second reference year.\nThis value is only derived for grassland change pixels which identify as grassland gains or losses.\n\n\n3.3.8 Aggregated products – Grassland (GRA)100m\nA further 100m Grassland layer is derived through aggregation from the Grassland layer at 10m spatial resolution. To this end, all grassland 10m GRA pixels within the extent of a GRA 100m pixel are counted and reported as the aggregated GRA 100m value in the range [0, 100]. No data values such as 255 are ignored and not counted during the aggregation.\n\n\n3.3.9 Encountered issues and known limitations\nInitial tests demonstrated that the HER time-series was susceptible to false positive changes which in turn generated false positive changes in the GRA time-series and the GRAC.\nThis issue was addressed by harmonizing the HER time-series by comparing it with a change layer derived from the HR-VPP PPI (see Section 3.3.6). A HER pixel is only allowed to change from one year to the next if there is a strong enough signal change detected in the HR-VPP PPI. The rules were applied more rigorously to ensure a higher consistency. The following Error! Reference source not found. shows an example of the GRAC layer in EEA tile E39N31 comparing changes from the previous test production vs. the processor deployed in production. The number of positive and negative changes decreased significantly due to the harder constraints on change during the years. The restrictions on HER layers being more consistent throughout the years propagates further to the GRA and GRAC layers.\n\n\n\nFigure 9: Comparison of GRAC layers from test production and current production taken from EEA tile E39N31 (upper example in the centre around (3957750, 3114334), lower example in the centre around (3984094, 3150073). Blue areas indicate grassland gain, red areas indicate grassland loss (for year 2018 to 2021).\n\n\nThe HIS-PLOUGH from 2012 to 2015 is based on Landsat data and hence not fully consistent in terms of quality and resolution (20m) with the PLOUGH for later reference years (10m, based on Sentinel-2). This issue was already realized during the HRL 2018 production and at the time it was decided to rely on the HIS-PLOUGH for the years 2016-2018 only9. The same strategy would lead to continuously decreasing grassland extent in the 2017-2021 time series and thus, the full PLOUGH time series was hence considered to mitigate the issue. However, the variable resolution and quality of the early HIS-PLOUGH years still propagates to some degree to the Grassland (GRA) time-series (Error! Reference source not found.).\nThis limitation is generally difficult to be solved completely due to the unavailability of suitable Sentinel-2 time-series before 2017.\n\n\n\nFigure 10: EEA tile E35N25. On the left side PLOUGH 2015 in 20 m and on the right side, the PLOUGH 2017-2021. The orange (left) and the yellow (right) patch in the centre of the figures comes from the HIST-PLOUGH and therefore shows the outline of the 20 m pixel size at that time.\n\n\nThe introduction of the HER has caused inconsistency issues between the HER, GRA and the HISPLOUGH. Therefore, the HIS-PLOUGH product was adapted as the following: Class 0 - indication of ploughing in current year, former class 0 converted to class 253, class 100 will contain all pixel that change between two years due to changes in the HER but not ploughed to maintain consistency between PLOUGH, GRA and HER layers. Please refer to Error! Reference source not found. for a side-by-side view of the old and new class coding.\n\n\n\nFigure 11: Colour palette and attributes of PLOUGH layer.

    "text": "3.4 HRL Grasslands mowing layers\nI this section the methods and workflows for the production of the layers, Grassland Mowing Events (GRAME), Grassland Mowing Dates (GRAMD) and the Grassland Mowing Events Confidence Layer (GRAMECL) are explained in more detail.\n\n3.4.1 Input data\nThe main source of information for the Grassland Mowing (GRAM) layers are time series of high-resolution Sentinel-2 satellite data. Both processing Sentinel-2 processing levels Level-1C and Level 2A are used in the processing chain. Since undetected clouds and cloud shadows remain a significant drawback for the time-series analysis additional custom cloud masks are required. Sentinel-2 Level-1C product (providing Top-Of-Atmosphere reflectance images) serves as the primary input for the calculation of cloud masks. The Level-2A product (Bottom-OfAtmosphere reflectance as provided by WEkEO / ESA), serves as the primary input for the mowing detection via a time-series analysis. In addition to Sentinel-2 imagery, additional auxiliary data are needed:\n\nCLMS High Resolution Vegetation Phenology and Productivity layer (HR-VPP): Startof-Season Date (SOSD) and End-of-Season Date (EOSD) (to calculate growing season parameters,\nCLMS HRL Herbaceous layer (HER) mask to perform the analysis only on the detected herbaceous area.\n\n\n\n3.4.2 Grassland Mowing Dates (GRAMD)\nBased on a thorough analysis of available methodologies and experiences from CAP-based monitoring of mowing events, a methodology closely following the approach of Griffiths et al., 2020, was developed. Mowing events are determined by looking for disturbances (unusually sharp drops in biophysical signal) compared to a reference value. To determine the reference value, a reference time series model approximating the theoretical phenology of undisturbed grassland was developed. Griffiths et al. (2020) have shown that using an idealized phenological model as an upper envelope allows mowing events to be identified as deviations from the idealized model.\nAs opposed to Griffiths et al. (2020), who used a compositing technique to combine Sentinel-2 and Landsat 8 data into temporally equally spaced time series, we only use time series of the available cloud-free (pixelwise) Sentinel-2 images.\nAnother difference concerns the determination of the reference - the “idealized phenological model” - used for the calculation of the residuals, which are in turn used to detect the mowing events. Griffiths et al. (2020) developed an algorithm for selecting some points to be used to fit a third order polynomial. The result of the fit is then the reference used for the calculation of the residuals. Explorative studies conducted at the beginning of the test period yielded comparable results when selecting the points and using third order polynomials, and when simply using the entire time series and fitting second order polynomials to the data points. An adjustment to the threshold for the residuals that determine whether a mowing event has occurred was needed.\nExamples of the algorithm results are shown in Figure 12 and Figure 13. The NDVI time series refer to single pixels within fields in the Sentinel-2 test tile 32TPT, for which we could obtain exact dates of the mowing events from reliable ground-truth data. Cloud and shadow masking is performed by combining Sen2Cor SCL and Cloudsen12 (Aybar et al. 2022). As demonstrated by the plots, the observations are sufficiently dense and cloud/cloud shadow masking performed well, allowing for clear detection of most mowing events. Two false negatives are seen in both Figure 12 and Figure 13.\nA high-level overview of the first part of the workflow that is deployed to derive an intermediate version of the mowing dates, event counts and confidence layers is presented in Figure 14.\n\n\n\nFigure 12: Single-pixel NDVI time series and mowing events (ground truth and detected) for 2021 (32TPT; WGS84 coordinates: 11.3151°E, 47.5911°N).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 13: Single-pixel NDVI time series and mowing events (ground truth and detected) for 2021 (32TPT; WGS84 coordinates: 11.3103°E, 47.5884°N).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 14: Processing workflow and pipeline for the GRAMD and GRAME layers part 1: Source data selection, pre-processing and cloud masking, and mowing event detection.\n\n\nThe mowing detection algorithm is season-based, meaning that a start and end of season are needed for the analysis of the time series. Extending the time window of the analysis beyond the true length of the growing season would result in a strong increase in false positive detections, while the consequence of using too short of a time window is the strong increase of false negatives (i.e., mowing events are not detected, being outside the analyzed time frame). The determination of the season length has been performed on Sentinel-2 tile basis, exploiting the HR-VPP layers (see section 3.3.1). By default, we use the 25th percentile of the start of season and the 75th percentile of the end of season of the herbaceous surfaces of the considered tile.\nNDVI time-series are computed from the Sentinel-2 L2A, observations with clouds or shadows are removed, and the mowing event detection algorithm described above is applied within the determined vegetation season. The detection of mowing events is limited to a maximum of four events per season.\nA high-level overview of the subsequent steps of the workflow is presented in Figure 15.\n\n\n\nFigure 15: Processing workflow and pipeline for the GRAMD and GRAME layers: reprojection, shift to yearly timeframes, mosaic, MMU filtering and data export.\n\n\nWhile in most tiles the start and end of season are within a single year, some climatic areas can have a start of season in the previous year, combined with an early end of season. In those cases, the final product is derived by the combination of the season-based products, keeping only the dates within the year of interest.\nFollowing the steps described above, the GRAMD layers in Sentinel-2 tiles are mosaicked to form EEA tiles. Furthermore, GDAL sieve is applied, aiming at reducing the unavoidable noise in the resulting raster due to fluctuations in time and space of the NDVI values. The minimum mapping unit of 0.25 ha from the product specifications corresponds to 25 pixels. The sieve filter is applied to the tile product with an extra buffer of 25 pixels, to avoid border effects at the tile boundaries, and the result is finally cropped back to the EEA tile extension. For known limitations of the spatial sieving on a multi-valued date laser please refer to section 3.4.5)\nSummarizing, the following steps are needed to derive the GRAMD layers:\n\nDetermination of start and end of season using HR-VPP SOSD and EOSD layers, masked with HER layers.\nComputation of cloud and shadow masks for dates within the growing season period.\nComputation of NDVI for dates within the growing season period, and application of cloud and shadow mask.\nApplication of the mowing detection algorithm on herbaceous pixels (according to HER layer);\nIf applicable, re-grouping of mowing events, from season to year.\nApplication of the MMU of 25 pixels (0.25 ha);\nFinalizing steps (creation of the Cloud-Optimized-GeoTiffs, color tables, metadata).\n\n\n\n3.4.3 Grassland Mowing Events (GRAME)\nAfter the application of the sieve filter to the GRAMD layers, the GRAME layer is derived by counting non-zero events for each pixel.\nThe following steps are needed to derive the GRAME layers:\n\nCount of non-zero occurrences in the stack of GRAMD layers (pixelwise);\nFinalizing steps (creation of the Cloud-Optimized-GeoTiffs, color tables, metadata)\n\n\n\n3.4.4 Grassland Mowing Event Confidence Layer (GRAMECL)\nLong gaps in the time series reduce the capability of detecting mowing events (see also section Section 3.4.5). The confidence layer provides an indication of the likelihood of not having missed a mowing event and combines it with the individual confidence of each of the detected events.\nThe Grassland Mowing Event Confidence Layer (GRAMECL) gives an estimate of the confidence that the occurrence of the false negative and false positive events is minimized. All the GRAMD layers and the GRAME layer are required to derive GRAMECL. The confidence is computed as\n\nwhere  and  are the confidences of minimizing the occurrence of the false negative and the false positive events, respectively. Both  and  are calculated in the range [0,1] (as detailed below), such that the final confidence is in the range , with the highest value interpreted as the 100% probability that no true mowing event was missed and no false mowing event was incorrectly detected.\nThe confidence  is concerned with gaps in the pixelwise time series. These gaps arise either from the prolonged periods of cloudiness, or due to the intrinsic gap due to the Sentinel-2 revisit time (as high as 10-15 days in certain areas), and they can be responsible for missing mowing events (false negatives). This issue is addressed, and the definition for the confidence  is developed as follows. Supposing that a given pixel has  available points in the time series, a probability that an event was missed between any two consecutive points is defined as:\n\nHere,  represents a time gap between the 𝑖-th and the -th observation in the time series, and  is a predefined tolerance window, in this case set to  days. If the time interval between the two observations is smaller than  according to this definition the probability that an event was missed increases linearly with the time gap . In case the interval between the two observations is larger than the predefined window, the probability of a missed event is assumed to be 1. The total probability that an event was missed is then obtained as a weighted average over all the time intervals  (for ), namely:\n\nWhere  is the total length of the time series (i.e., length of the growing season in days). The final confidence is obtained as .\nThe confidence  is concerned with the imperfections in the cloud masking. Namely, events such as shadows, haze or thin clouds can be missed by the masking algorithm, and they can lead to incorrectly detected mowing events (false positives). This issue is addressed, and the definition for the confidence  is developed as follows. For a given pixel, all the mowing events detected within the GRAMD layers are iterated over. For an -th mowing event, image filtering is applied to its corresponding cloud mask, using an identity kernel. More specifically, a custom kernel (filter) is introduced as a normalized 2D identity array of the shape , thus defining a relevant area of +/- 30 pixels (300 m) around the pixel of interest. The result of the filtering is the percentage of clear pixels in the area defined by the kernel, . The values of  indicate the proximity of the pixel to any nearby clouds, which in turn lowers the confidence that the pixel in question is a clear pixel, free from any cloud or shadow. In addition, we compute the tile-based percentage of thin clouds detected within the Sentinel-2 tile,  (this information is straightforwardly computed from the generated Cloudsen12 cloud masks). The confidence that the -th mowing event is not a false positive is then obtained as\n\nThe final confidence follows as the product over all single-day confidences, \n\n\n3.4.5 Encountered issues and known limitations\nDuring the implementation and production of the GRAM layers some issues have been identified. These can be divided into several subgroups:\nMMU-related\nThe requirement of a Minimum Mapping Unit for the GRAMD layers, albeit resulting in more uniform results, also yields some issues resulting from the need to apply a spatial filtering on complex layers presenting dates and counts.\n\nThe HER layer used for determining the areas where to apply the mowing detection algorithm does not have an MMU. It is therefore not possible to satisfy both the mapping of mowing events for all herbaceous pixels and the MMU of 0.25 ha of the GRAMD. As a result, the GRAMD still contains patches below the MMU in particular in small HER patches.\nThe GDAL sieve10 filter needs to be applied independently to each of the four GRAMD layers. This filter ensures that patches of DOY-values smaller than the threshold of 0.25 ha (25 pixels) are replaced by the value of the largest neighboring patch, but only if the size of the neighboring patch is larger than the threshold. Since this filtering is applied individually to each GRAMD layer (GRAMD_1, GRAMD_2, …), in some cases, the newly assigned value is already present in one of the other mowing event date layers at the same location (i.e. the same pixels). In such cases, it results in date duplication, where timing of the first mowing event (GRAMD_1) and the second mowing event (GRAMD_2) share the same DOY. This occurs in approximately 0.4 % of the herbaceous pixels.\nThe independent filtering of the GRAMD layers explained in the previous point can also result in a fictitious increase in the mowing count of the GRAME layer. Furthermore, the MMU requirement cannot be guaranteed in the resulting GRAME layer, because the MMU-compliant patches in the single GRAMD layers could overlap in an “unfavorable” manner. On the other hand, not re-counting the events after sieving or applying a second filter on the GRAME would result in strong inconsistencies across the different layers.\n\nVerification and quality control\nA quality assessment of the GRAM layer is very challenging due to lack of reliable and representative ground-truth data across Europe.\nRelated EO input data\nCloud cover can strongly reduce availability of usable data. This issue is dependent on the region, with an example of average cloudiness shown in Figure 16 (a). Sentinel-2 observation pattern and the associated swath borders lead to differences in the data availability in different regions, with some regions experiencing an average gap as high as 10-15 days (in combination with cloud coverage). The Sentinel-2 observation gaps are shown in Figure 16 (b). These gaps can result in noticeable border issues/data stripes in the GRAME product (see Figure 17).\nIn some case the atmospheric correction of the L2A also seems to be a cause of false positive mowing detection. Further investigations in this regard will be needed.\nCross-year season\nFor some tiles with an early start of the vegetation period, the mowing season associated with a reference year may begin in the previous calendar year. Likewise, the subsequent season, which for the next year, may already start within a given reference year. Since the production of the VLCC products (incl. the GRAM) has been conducted in several phases (2017-2021, 2022-2023, 2024) this can result in incomplete detection of mowing events for the final year in the production interval, as data from the following season is not yet processed. To ensure consistency and completeness, it may be necessary to include an additional year of data for tiles with early season starts and for the final year of the production interval.\n\n\n\nFigure 16: Sentinel-2A and - 2B L1C data coverage in 2018. Shown are (a) average cloudiness, and (b) average gap between cloud-free observations.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 17: Visibility of the Sentinel-2 swath borders and the different swath coverage in the GRAME layer (32TPT; WGS84 coordinates: 10.63480°E, 47.65318°N)."

    "text": "3.5 HRL Crop Type\nThis section gives an overview of the methodology employed to produce the layers Crop Type (CTY) and the Crop Type Confidence Layer (CTYCL).\n\n3.5.1 Input data\nBefore the pixel-based inputs are fed to the model, minimal pre-processing is applied to transform the raw inputs to a consistent format. Optical Sentinel-2 data is first cloud-masked based on the official L2A scene classification value to which an erosion-dilation process is applied to enhance the cloud/shadow mask. Next, a 10-day compositing window is applied where the median operator is used if multiple observations are available. Finally, any remaining missing values are linearly interpolated to prevent gaps in the input data, as the presence of ‘no data’ values can lead to model instability. The 20m optical bands are resampled to 10m resolution by applying a nearest neighbour interpolation.\nSentinel-1 backscatter is derived from Level-1 GRD (Ground Range Detected) products, which have been pre-processed to correct for geometric distortions. To obtain meaningful surface backscatter values, sigma nought backscatter is calculated from these GRD products using the ellipsoidal Earth model. For enhanced accuracy, the Copernicus 30 m Digital Elevation Model (DEM) is also applied to support radiometric correction, compensating for terrain effects and ensuring consistent backscatter values across varying landscapes. By default, only one orbit direction (Descending) is kept, as the model is designed to handle a single Sentinel-1 orbit pass. Combining ascending and descending orbits could mix signals acquired under different viewing geometries, potentially leading to a loss of relevant information. Additionally, using both orbits would significantly increase processing costs without a clear benefit for model performance. The available observations are composited with the 10-day windows where multiple acquisitions are averaged. Any rare missing values are linearly interpolated. Finally, the backscatter intensity values are converted to decibel values. If there is insufficient Descending data (data gaps &gt; 10 days, especially happened over northern Europe) also Ascending data is used.\nThe Copernicus 30m DEM is used to derive altitude and slope at the pixel level, for which resampling to the Sentinel-2 10m grid is performed. Finally, the daily mean temperature variable is extracted from the original AgERA5 meteorological data, aggregated into 10-day intervals, and resampled to the Sentinel-2 10 m grid.\n\n\n3.5.2 Classification algorithm and inference\nThe classification algorithm consists of a transformer-based feature extractor followed by a downstream crop classification head (Vaswani et al., 2017; Zerveas et al., 2021) (Figure 18). These two parts are coupled into one model which is trained end-to-end based on the available training data. Input to the model are the aligned inputs from the source-specific preprocessing steps. Time series from optical Sentinel-2 bands (“B02”, “B03”, “B04”, “B05”, “B06”, “B07”, “B08”, “B11”, “B12”) and radar Sentinel-1 backscatter (VH and VV) are jointly fed into a transformer-based encoder, which is designed to automatically extract the most relevant features for crop type classification. To better align similar inputs from different regions in Europe, the encoder model simultaneously has access to the temperature time series data in order to better differentiate the observed satellite time series across varying meteorological conditions. The transformer architecture contains an attention mechanism that learns to extract relevant information within and across the different input data streams. The original optical Sentinel-2 bands, radar Sentinel1 backscatter intensities, and meteorological time series are directly fed into the transformer encoder for automated feature extraction. Inputs that lack a temporal dimension are fed as scalars to a dense encoder for simple feature extraction. The output of the feature extractor (encoder) part represents a highly condensed and informative representation of the inputs and because the model is trained in a fully-supervised manner, the extracted features are already finetuned towards a crop classification task. Traditional manual feature engineering is hence not needed in this setup.\nOnce the features (embeddings) have been extracted, explicit fusion of the different inputs happens by concatenating these features before feeding them to a multi-layer perceptron classification head consisting of several stacked dense layers. Final output of the classification head is a probability of an input belonging to a crop type label, with probabilities of all labels summing to one. Final classification is performed by assigning to each 10m pixel from the 19 crop type classes the label that has the highest probability.\nThe model was trained on an extensive in-situ dataset of almost one million samples compiled from LPIS-GSA, LUCAS datasets and active learning sampling (Table 3) (Eurostat, 2018). The original LPIS-GSA and LUCAS datasets have each been fully harmonised towards a common crop type nomenclature (available for download, here). The harmonized version of each dataset, along with the harmonization procedure and the translation of original crop type labels to harmonized labels, have all been published on the WorldCereal Reference Data Module (RDM) and are available for anyone to use. More general information about this harmonization procedure and on how to navigate the WorldCereal RDM application, is available on the WorldCereal documentation portal. In a next step, each individual dataset has been subsampled to derive a representative training dataset at European scale, avoiding as much as possible spatial and temporal bias and ensuring a label-balanced training dataset. This subsampling was done in an iterative way for each dataset separately:\n\nA fully random sample was drawn across all crop types available in the dataset. The initial sample size was chosen dynamically per dataset depending on the dataset’s spatial extent and the number of years available for the region. This first random step ensured the most dominant crop types for the region were sufficiently represented. Only grassland was ignored during this initial stage, to avoid massive bias towards this dominant land cover class.\nOn top of the initial random sampling stage, we identified a number of “focus crops” for which we ensured a minimum number of samples taken from the dataset. Focus crops were defined as the target crops to be included in the eventual pan-European crop type maps. In case of cereals, the most dominant cereal types (wheat, barley, rye, oats, triticale) were sampled separately. Again, the minimum number of crop-specific samples were defined dynamically per dataset, depending on its spatial and temporal extent.\nDepending on early model iterations and testing, additional samples for targeted crop types in targeted regions were dynamically added to the training dataset. This for instance included additional wheat and barley data in Southern Europe.\n\nFinally, all training data was merged into a final representative training dataset, which was used to train a single model that generalizes well across all regions and can be reused for crop classification on a yearly basis.\n\n\n\nFigure 18: Schematic overview of the crop type model architecture\n\n\nTable 3: Overview of the used training points per dataset and year for the CTY model training\n\n\n\nCountry/Region\nYears\nNumber training points\n\n\n\n\nAustria (LPIS/GSA)\n2018, 2019, 2020\n160 174\n\n\nGermany (LPIS/GSA)\n2021\n77031\n\n\nDenmark (LPIS/GSA)\n2019\n39596\n\n\nEstonia (LPIS/GSA)\n2021\n16874\n\n\nSpain (LPIS/GSA)\n2019, 2020, 2021\n133 830\n\n\nFinland (LPIS/GSA)\n2021\n28138\n\n\nBelgium (LPIS/GSA)\n2018, 2019, 2020, 2021\n52938\n\n\nFrance (LPIS/GSA)\n2019, 2020\n108 158\n\n\nCroatia (LPIS/GSA)\n2020\n12111\n\n\nLithuania (LPIS/GSA)\n2021\n26243\n\n\nLatvia (LPIS/GSA)\n2021\n42226\n\n\nSweden (LPIS/GSA)\n2021\n36374\n\n\nSlovakia (LPIS/GSA)\n2021\n46609\n\n\nEurope (LUCAS)\n2018\n26294\n\n\nEurope (Active learning)\n2019, 2020, 2021\n17196\n\n\n\nThe trained model is deployed as part of an OpenEO11 workflow that covers in an end-to-end way the cloud-based access to the required algorithm inputs, preprocessing steps as described above, model inference, and writing of the output product. Parallelisation is done automatically after tuning the necessary parameters such as the height and width of individual processing windows. The CTY processing is based on 20km LAEA sub-tiles of the original LAEA 100km grid.\n\n\n3.5.3 Post-processing\nIn the postprocessing pipeline (Figure 19 & Figure 20), each 20km LAEA sub-tile is postprocessed independently, except for the temporal rule-based postprocessing and the tile padding for GDAL Sieve steps. First, the cropland layer derived from BVL (classes ‘Annual arable cropland and perennial (permanent) crops’, ‘Tree crops’ and ‘Overlap herbaceous–Tree cover’) is applied as a basic mask, setting non-cropland pixels as well as out of scope zones. In that step, a correction is also performed for pixels which are classified as grass and fodder by the crop type model but for which the BVL considers them as permanent crops. In that case, the pixels crop types are changed to the permanent crop class with the highest probability. Then, remaining cropland pixels are reclassified by performing spatial smoothing with a gaussian kernel (3x3) on every perclass probability and re-assign the pixel’s class from the new highest probability. This allows to improve class consistency within fields, as the crop type classifier is pixel-based. The result of this process gives the intermediate crop type with grass/fodder crops included that is transferred to the herbaceous layer. The grass/fodder crops locations are removed from the crop type product for the next steps.\nAfterwards, an interannual consistency correction is applied on the full time series (2017-2021). Products on the same location but for different years are concatenated together before running the correction. The following three cases are covered:\n\nWhen a sequence of crop types consists of only permanent crops, except for one year (that is not in the edges) then corrects that sequence to the permanent crop class that has the maximum accumulated probability over the sequence. Cases from the edge years are excluded as they may indicate transitions between arable and permanent crop states. Thus, sufficient data is lacking to make reliable assumptions.\nWhen a full sequence (including edge years) of permanent crops does not have the same crop type, then sets that sequence with the permanent class that has the maximum accumulated probability over the sequence. This operation helps by having a more consistent prediction in permanent crop cases.\nWhen a pixel of permanent crop class is in-between two arable years, which could correspond to (temporarily) fallow conditions, this pixel is set to the background class (0). For the same reasons as described in the first point, the edge years are not modified by this operation.\n\nGrass and fodder classes are ignored in interannual consistency corrections and are treated as the background class. In addition, pixels that do not correspond to cropland for all the years of the analysis are ignored, as again the information is insufficient to make assumptions.\nThereafter, pixels where the maximum probability of all predicted classes is below 25% are set either to unclassified arable cropland or undecided permanent crop, dependent to which category the class with the highest probability belongs.\nIsolated pixels and small fields are finally cleaned using the GDAL Sieve operation with a MMU of 0.25 ha and connectivity 4. In addition to obtain more consistent land cover maps, this operation also ensures a minimum mapping unit of 0.25ha for each field. To avoid artefacts at the boundaries between tiles, a padding must be added to each sub-tile before running the spatial cleaning. Once the padding is performed, the GDAL Sieve operation replaces every field with an area below the threshold of 0.25ha by changing the class to the class of the neighbour field with the largest area, including the background class (0) in the calculation to remove small, isolated fields. Pixels that were excluded by previous operations remain excluded after GDAL Sieve.\nFinally, 20km sub-tiles are combined in larger tiles to obtain the final 100km crop-type and probability products.\n\n\n\nFigure 19: CTY postprocessing pipeline flowchart\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 20: Decision tree of the CTY postprocessing pipeline, outlining the main steps from raw crop type probabilities to final output classes. For clarity, output categories are simplified to ‘permanent’ and ‘annual’ cropland, as the decision rules were specifically designed for these classes. Note that spatial operations (defined in Figure 19) such as spatial smoothing and GDAL Sieve, although they may further modify crop type labels, are not included in this diagram to maintain readability\n\n\n\n\n3.5.4 Crop Type Confidence Layer\nThe Crop Type Confidence Layer (CTYCL) provides a per-pixel estimate of the classification confidence by reporting the final probability associated with the selected crop type label at 10-meter resolution. This probability originates from the crop type classification model output, where each crop class is assigned a confidence value. However, the final probability values may be modified during the crop type postprocessing chain, which ensures spatial and temporal consistency. Specifically, the following chronological steps can influence the confidence values:\n\nSpatial smoothing: A 3×3 Gaussian filter is applied to the per-class probability output, enhancing spatial coherence across neighbouring pixels. Pixel classes are re-assigned based on the updated highest probability, which may differ from the original model output.\nInterannual consistency correction (see also above): When a permanent crop is missing (excluding edge years) in a single year of an otherwise consistent time series, or when the sequence includes different permanent crop types, the final crop type class will be adjusted. In these cases, the pixel’s confidence value is recalculated as the average probability of the selected permanent crop class across the time series.\nGDAL Sieve operation: To remove small, isolated patches, pixel values are reassigned based on the dominant neighbouring class. If a pixel’s class is changed during this step, its probability is updated to reflect the confidence of the newly assigned class.\n\nPixels that are reassigned to the background class during postprocessing steps are assigned the “no cropland” confidence value of 253.\n\n\n3.5.5 Encountered issues and know limitations\nDuring the quality assurance process, minor violations of the minimum mapping unit (MMU) requirement were detected in non-cropland areas of the crop type layer (2017-2021).Specifically, the issue arose due to the GDAL Sieve operation being applied in a single pass. While a single pass may suffice for layers with a limited number of classes, it is not adequate when more than four distinct classes are present. In such cases, multiple sieving iterations are necessary to fully enforce the MMU constraint.\nAlthough the original implementation included checks to address this limitation, non-cropland pixels were unintentional excluded from these checks. As a result, small patches of non-cropland remained below the MMU threshold. The overall impact of this issue is minimal, affecting approximately 0.0002% of the total crop type pixels.\nDespite the application of postprocessing steps aimed at improving consistency, some implausible crop type sequences remain in the final crop type product (2017-2021). These arise from the inherent trade-off between enforcing temporal and spatial consistency. Interannual consistency checks promote temporal stability across years, while spatial consistency is enhanced using the GDAL Sieve operation. However, strictly enforcing both constraints would result in overly homogeneous patches, undermining the high-resolution detail offered by the 10-meter product.\nThis challenge is particularly pronounced in heterogeneous and complex landscapes such as those found in southern Europe, including agroforestry systems like Dehesa. In such regions, mixed sequences of permanent and annual crops may still appear, even if they are agronomically unlikely.\nAdditionally, the presence of the no-cropland class (label 0) within a sequence can be explained by various factors. These include the removal of grass/fodder pixels during postprocessing, reclassification through interannual consistency checks, or changes introduced by the GDAL Sieve operation. Such instances result in discontinuities within the crop type sequences.\nFinally, the limited five-year time span of the dataset may not be sufficient to fully identify and correct all implausible sequences. Future observations beyond this period could help to better identify consistent crop type sequences and further reduce inconsistencies."

    "text": "3.6 HRL Cropping Pattern\nThis section gives an overview of the methodology employed to produce the Cropping Patterns (CP) layers which includes a comprehensive of layers that provide details on the timing and extent of agricultural practices along five thematic groups being Main crops, Bare soil, Secondary crops, Fallow land and Cropping Seasons.\n\n3.6.1 Input data\nThe HRL Cropping Patterns (CP) layers entail a wide set of layers relying on both Sentinel-2 optical and Sentinel-1 SAR-based satellite data. The HRL CTY layer is used to define the focus locations of the CP layers generation.\nSentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 backscatter data are pre-processed in a similar way as for the CTY layer, with some minor differences. In case of Sentinel-2 only a subset of relevant bands is retained, including band 2,3,4,8, 11 and the incident angles information. The latter is needed to derive fraction of Absorbed Photosynthetic Active Radiation (fAPAR) at 10m.\nFor the Sentinel-1 backscatter both the ascending and descending orbits information are combined to ensure maximum data availability required for detecting abrupt events like field harvest. Extraction of the data is done at field level, resulting in timeseries per field. Field boundaries are defined using a delineation algorithm.\n\n\n3.6.2 Product structure\nThe CP portfolio compromises a diverse range of layers, derived from field level seasonal information. The methodology used to obtain field level seasonal information and derived cropping pattern layers is shown in Figure 21. In a first step, the locations for which CP layers are derived are filtered, i.e., only fields that are delineated and are dominantly covered by an annual crop are retained. The field delineations are obtained by using a 3D Res-UNet field delineation algorithm which uses Sentinel-2 images. Only fields above the MMU of 0.25 ha and which are classified as an annual crop by the CTY layer are retained. For this subset of delineated fields, Sentinel-1, and Sentinel-2 timeseries are retrieved, which are necessary inputs for the harvest and emergence detection. The detected harvest and emergence events are used to derive a maximum of two growing seasons per year based on expert rules. The workflow results in several CP layers, which are subdivided into 5 thematic themes:\n\nMain crops\nBare soil\nSecondary crops\nFallow land\nCropping Seasons\n\nAll vector-based CP layers are rasterized to 10 m spatial resolution to align with HRL CTY layer. Although the original CP layers are derived exclusively from delineated parcels larger than the defined MMU of 0.25 ha, a final spatial alignment with the HRL CTY layer is required to ensure consistency across product layers. This alignment step involves clipping the field-based CP outputs to the CTY-classified (pixel-based) annual cropland extent. As a result, some CP outputs—originally MMU-compliant—may appear as smaller spatial fragments due to partial overlap at field boundaries. While this may produce local patterns below the MMU threshold, these are a by-product of spatial alignment rather than the initial CP derivation. Reapplying a sieving operation at this stage to enforce the MMU would risk removing valid and relevant CP information, particularly in transitional or fragmented agricultural landscapes. Moreover, the clipping step alone already leads to some loss of CP content, and further filtering would compound this loss.\nIn the following sections, the methods used to delineate growing season(s) and derive the corresponding CP layers are described.\n\n\n\nFigure 21: Schematic overview of cropping pattern products generation.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.3 Growing season delineation\nThe growing season delineation at field level forms the basis for the CP layers generation. The methodology used to determine the growing season delineation is shown in Figure 22. The onset and end of the season is based on the detected emergence and harvest events (see sections below), respectively. The detected emergence and harvest events are used in expert rules to determine the growing seasons (see sections below).\n\n\n\nFigure 22: Schematic overview of the growing season delineation.\n\n\n\n3.6.3.1 Emergence detection\nThe inflection behavior of the spectral signal around the moment of emergence is used to detect emergence events. As spectral signal, daily fAPAR values obtained from the CropSAR technology are used. CropSAR is a deep learning method that allows to fill-in the cloud gaps in fAPAR timeseries using the relationship between Sentinel-2 fAPAR and Sentinel-1 backscatter data (CropSAR, 2024; Piccard et al., 2023). Optical fAPAR data were preferred to Sentinel-1 derived features since fAPAR is not influenced by soil structure and moisture content around emergence (Khabbazan et al, 2019). Additionally, the change of fAPAR around the emergence period is quite gradual. A rule-based approach was used to determine emergence events as deep learning methods depend on a substantial amount of training which were not available.\nField data on emergence dates (+- 200) of agricultural fields, located mainly in Belgium, were used to investigate the behavior of the fAPAR signal around emergence. From this, generalizable rules and threshold could be defined to allow a robust and consistent emergence detection as shown on Figure 23. The values of the parameters are obtained by applying a Monte Carlo simulation. Emergence is detected shortly after the occurrence of a slope inflection of the CropSAR timeseries (Figure 23), this is also confirmed in literature (Gao et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2021). Some additional parameters are used to check if the slope inflection is related with a clear seasonal signal (i.e., amplitude, duration until season peak, …). Within the literature it is also clearly confirmed that emergence typically occur after an inflection of the time series from optical derived data (Gao et al., 2017; Gao et al., 2021). The detected emergence date corresponds with the unfolding of the first leaves of the crop on the field.\n\n\n\nFigure 23: Different parameters selected for detecting an emergence event out of a seasonal profile.\n\n\n\n\n3.6.3.2 Harvest detection\nHarvest is defined as the moment of total removal of standing biomass from the field. For the harvest detection, a sequential neural network is trained to identify a harvest event out of set of selected satellite derived features. 600 fields with information on harvest date (both on the main season and for some on the secondary season) are used for model training. Most of these fields are in Belgium, Italy, Greece, and Austria and cover a wide range of the most common cultivated crops. The model is trained such that a detection of a harvest event aligns with the agreed definition on harvest. The following spectral features are used in the harvest detection algorithm:\n\nfAPAR (CropSAR)\nSentinel-2 Normalized Burnt Ratio 2 (NBR2) (Alcaras et al., 2022)\nVH/VV in decibels derived from Sentinel-1 backscatter.\n\nThe selected features complement each other. The VH/VV ratio does respond more to the structural changes of the field at harvest, while the other two features do react more on the biophysical change (Meroni et al., 2021; Van Tricht et al., 2018). The NBR2 is added as it is particularly sensitive for harvest at low fAPAR values. This typically occurs in cover crops or maize that are in a far stage of senescence at harvest. In such case, the fAPAR signal is not enough to properly detect a harvest event and the signal received from VH/VV is not that clear anymore due to the collapse (loss of structure) of the crop. All the different features are brought on a 6-daily temporal scale, in case of the NBR2 a Whittaker smoother has been applied to fill-in the cloud induced gaps. Gaps in Sentinel-1 VH/VV are linearly interpolated. The 6-daily time series of CropSAR, NBR2 and VH/VV are used in the harvest detection sequential neural network model.\n\n\n3.6.3.3 Season delineation\nFor the season delineation, all the emergence and harvest events in a period of 6 months before and after the reference year of interest are retained. This six-month period is added to also be able to detect seasonalities that do not fall within the year boundaries (e.g., secondary crops and winter cereals). In the first step, the emergence and harvest detections are cleaned and associated with a single seasonality to categorize it as either a main or secondary season. A series of expert rules, derived from an examination of seasonal boundaries at the European level in conjunction with United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) crop calendar data, are used for labeling the seasons (see Table 4). These rules are fully independent from the CTY crop labels to avoid error propagation. For both main and secondary crops, some further sub-seasonality labelling is done to differentiate between winter & spring crops and secondary crops growing before or after the main growing season of that reference year. Each of these sub-seasonality categories have different periods in which they can occur (Table 4). The sub-seasonality categorization can further assist in prioritizing the final selection of the labelled seasons as main or secondary season if multiple seasons conflict within one of these categories.\nAdditionally, also regional dependent seasonal bounds are defined due to different growing season periods within Europe. Therefore, Europe has been divided into two zones based on the Metzger environmental zones, which is based on variations in climatic conditions across the continent, for seasonal labeling (Metzger et al. 2018). The translation of the original environmental zones into the two zones is shown in Table 5. The subdivision is mainly dividing more temperate/cold climates from warm/Mediterranean climates within the European continent. In the latter, onset of the main growing season is substantially earlier compared to the colder climates where temperature delays the season onset.\nThe expert rules for season labelling are described below:\n\nEmergence and harvest are chronologically linked together into a season.\nA season that ends before the start of the reference year or starts after the end of that year, is removed.\nSeasons with a length below 40 days or above 365 days are removed.\nThe remaining seasons are labelled into one of the following options (based on the defined limits in Table 4):\n\nSpring crop\nWinter crop\nSecondary crop before the main season\nSecondary crop after the main season\nNo labelling possible (if it does not fit to one of the above categories)\n\nIf a season falls in the seasonal limits of two types of sub-seasons, the following labelling priority is given:\n\nOverlap between winter and spring crop season:\n\nDays overlap season in spring crop season period &gt; days overlap in winter season period → spring crop.\nDays overlap season in spring crop season period = days overlap in winter season period → spring crop.\nDays overlap season in spring crop season period &lt; days overlap in winter season period → winter crop.\n\nOverlap between spring crop and secondary crop after main season → spring crop.\n\nEventually, the final seasons used for generating the layers on main and secondary crops are defined as follows if there is a conflict (multiple occurrences) in one of these categories:\n\nMain season:\n\nSpring crop season &gt; winter crop season\n\n\nSecondary cover crop season:\n\nAfter the main season &gt; before the main season\n\n\n\n\nIf no main season is detected for a specific field in a certain reference year also no secondary crop season information is provided.\nTable 4: Expert rules with seasonal limits for season delineation based on emergence and harvest input.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType season\nZone\nSub-seasonality\nEmergence period\nHarvest period\n\n\n\n\nMain season\n1\nWinter crop\n15/08(year-1)→ 30/04(())\n01/(06_{()}) → 15 (;/09_{(r)})\n\n\nMain season\n1\nSpring crop\n(01/04_{(}/07_{(})\n(01/07_{()}/1)(1/12_{(})\n\n\nMain season\n2\nWinter crop\n15 (/08_{()}/03_{(})\n(01/04_{(}/08_{(})\n\n\nMain season\n2\nSpring crop\n01/(03_{()}/07_{()})\n(01/06_{(}-)()/01((1))\n\n\nSecondary season\n1\nBefore main season\n01/01 (.()))→ (30/04_{()}))\n01/01 (.()))→ (30/04_{()}))\n\n\nSecondary season\n1\nAfter main season\n1 (.5.)/0 (7_{()}))→ (30/04_{(}))\n1 (.5.)/0 (7_{()}))→ (30/04_{(}))\n\n\nSecondary season\n2\nBefore main season\n(01/01_{()})(/03_{(y e a r)})\n(01/01_{()})(/03_{(y e a r)})\n\n\nSecondary season\n2\nAfter main season\n1 (5/06_{()}/03_{(+1)})\n1 (5/06_{()}/03_{(+1)})\n\n\n\nTable 5: Translation of Metzger environmental zones into a zone used with the same season delineation limits.\n\n\n\nEnvironmental zone (Metzger)\nZone\n\n\n\n\nAlpine north\n1\n\n\nBoreal\n1\n\n\nNemoral\n1\n\n\nAtlantic north\n1\n\n\nAtlantic south\n1\n\n\nContinental\n1\n\n\nAtlantic central\n1\n\n\nPannonian\n2\n\n\nLusitanian\n2\n\n\nAnatolian\n2\n\n\nMediterranean mountains\n2\n\n\nMediterranean north\n2\n\n\nMediterranean south\n2\n\n\nMacaronesia\n2\n\n\nArctic\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\n3.6.4 Confidence layers\nFor most of the CP layers confidence information is provided and is based on the uncertainty of the emergence and harvest detection used to delineate the growing season(s). This confidence is calculated based on the uncertainty of satellite observations at the date of emergence or harvest. The CropSAR technology used to fill-in cloud induced gaps of fAPAR provides this uncertainty interval of fAPAR at these dates, as the (10^{}) (q10) and 90th (q90) percentile. The emergence and harvest detection algorithm use the q50 values for their predictions. The emergence or harvest uncertainty in days is based on the upper (q90) and lower (q10) confidence of fAPAR at the event (i.e., emergence or harvest) date and the slope of fAPAR at event date (denoted as slope ) (see equation and Figure 24 below):\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 24: Schematic overview on the parameters used to calculate the uncertainty at an event data (i.e., emergence or harvest). Event date is in this example, an emergence.\n\n\nIn rare cases, this approach does not yield reliable results, for example when the slope around emergence or harvest is nearly zero. In these cases, the uncertainty is calculated as follows.\n\nIn case of emergence, the uncertainty is the number of days after the event to reach the q50 fAPAR value at emergence by the q10 time series. For harvest, the uncertainty in days can be estimated by the number of days before the harvest event that the q10 time series reach the q50 fAPAR value at harvest.\nIn case of emergence, the uncertainty in days can be estimated by the number of days before the emergence event that the q90 time series reach the q50 fAPAR value at emergence. For harvest, the uncertainty is the number of days after the event to reach the q50 fAPAR value at harvest by the q90 time series.\nThe total uncertainty is then determined by summing up the number of days determined in (1) and (2).\n\nNote that, during cloudy periods, the confidence interval will increase as the uncertainty on the fAPAR will also increase.\nFor most CP layers the uncertainties correspond to the uncertainties that are derived from the emergence and harvest date of the specific season. And exception is the Fallow Land Presence Confidence Layer (CPFLPCL) which is based on the Crop Type Confidence Layer (CTYCL) (which is by default below 35 for fallow fields) and set to:\n\nThe lower the CTYCL of a fallow field the higher the CPFLPCL. In case the CTYCL is below 10, the confidence for fallow land presence is confined at 100.\nThe Fallow Land Duration Confidence Layer (FLDCL) can only be calculated when a harvest date is utilized to determine the start or end of a fallow land period. The uncertainty on the harvest date is used to provide information on the fallow land duration confidence. If there is no harvest event on the fallow field, a flag is assigned to the layer. Like for the FLDCL layer, the sum of the uncertainties (whenever present) is taken over the five-year period to determine the corresponding uncertainty.\n\n\n3.6.5 Derivation of Main Crops, Bare Soil, Secondary Crops, Fallow Land and Cropping Seasons layers\nBased on the delineation of the growing season and the uncertainty of the fAPAR the raster layers for the five layer groups Main Crops, Bare Soil, Secondary Crops, Fallow Land and Cropping Seasons can be derived. This section provides further details on how this has been implemented.\n\n3.6.5.1 Main Crops\nFor all fields that do have a delineated main season and are not designated as fallow land (see section 3.6.5.4), the following layers based on the main seasonality are derived:\n\nMain Crop Harvest (MCH) + Confidence Layer (MCHCL)\nMain Crop Emergence (MCE) + Confidence Layer (MCECL)\nMain Crop Duration (MCD) + Confidence Layer (MCDCL)\n\nThe first two layers are directly derived from the emergence and harvest information of the delineated season. The confidence is derived from the uncertainty on the emergence or harvest date. The Main Crop Duration is the difference in days between the emergence and harvest of the season. The confidence of the crop duration is the average of the confidence on the emergence and harvest date.\n\n\n3.6.5.2 Bare soil\nThe Bare Soil (BS) layers define the number of days that a field is left bare before and after the main season. If no main season is detected for a specific field or the if the field is designated as fallow land (see section 3.6.5.4) no bare soil information is provided). The following two bare soil layers are produced:\n\nBare Soil Before main season (BSB) + Confidence Layer (BSBCL)\nBare Soil After main season (BSA) + Confidence Layer (BSACL)\n\nThe duration of the bare soil period following the main season is determined by calculating the number of days between the harvest of the main season and the subsequent emergence date. If there is no emergence date within the same reference year as the product, the bare soil period ends on the last day of the year. If the main season ends after the end of the reference year, no bare soil period after the main season is provided. Conversely, for the bare soil period preceding the main season, the days between the last harvest date prior to the main season and the emergence date are determined. If there is no preceding harvest date in the reference year, the bare soil period begins on the first day of the year. If the main season commences before the reference year, no bare soil period is considered, as it is only calculated for the year in which the layer is produced.\nThe confidence of the bare soil layer before and after the main season layers is determined by considering the uncertainty in the emergence or harvest dates that define the bare soil period. The average uncertainty in the emergence and/or harvest dates is used to calculate the uncertainty in the bare soil layers. If the bare soil period begins at the start of the reference year and does not align with a harvest event, only the uncertainty in the emergence of the main season start is considered for the calculation of the bare soil period before the main season. Conversely, if the bare soil period ends at the end of the reference year and does not align with an emergence event, only the uncertainty in the harvest event from the main season is considered for the calculation of the uncertainty in the bare soil period after the main season.\n\n\n3.6.5.3 Secondary Crops\nThe Secondary Crop (SC) season typically occurs during the off-season period. Typical secondary crops are cover crops, which are directly planted after the main season. These crops are often used to enhance soil quality, prevent soil erosion, and provide various other beneficial effects (Fendrich et al., 2023). As a result, in the season delineation labeling (see section 3.6.3), priority was given to secondary seasons that occur after the main growing season. If only one secondary growing season is delineated that starts in winter or early spring within the reference year, that season will be classified as a secondary season. The following layers are available for secondary crops, only if the field has a main season and a secondary season and is not classified as fallow land (see section Fallow land):\n\nSecondary Crops Type (SCT)\nSecondary Crops Emergence (SCE)\nSecondary Crops Duration (SCD) + Confidence Layer (SCDCL)\n\nThe first layer classifies the detected secondary crops into four categories:\n\nShort summer\nLong summer\nShort winter\nLong winter\n\nThe categorization of crops is determined by two parameters: the duration of the secondary season and the timing of its emergence. Through cluster analysis of these parameters, secondary crops can be classified into the described four categories. The distinction between short and long growing variants is based on the length of the season: if it is less than 100 days, it is considered short; otherwise, it is classified as long. Additionally, a secondary crop that emerges after the main growing season and before September is labeled as a summer variant, all other cases are classified as winter variants. Typically, a secondary crop season preceding the main season is categorized as a short growing winter variant.\nThe SCE layer can be directly derived from the emergence date of the delineated secondary crop season. The secondary crop season duration is calculated based on the difference in days between the harvest and emergence date. The confidence of the SCD is the average of the confidence on the emergence and harvest date.\n\n\n3.6.5.4 Fallow land\nFallow land is defined as agricultural land where, temporarily, no agricultural activity takes place. The detection of fallow land is performed on a subset of the parcels used for the CP, i.e. only those fields where on average the CTY confidence within the field is below 35, are assessed.\nFollowing layers are generated for fallow land:\n➢ Fallow Land Presence (FLP) + Confidence Layer (FLPCL)\n➢ Fallow Land Duration (FLD) + Confidence Layer (FLDCL)\nFallow land presence classification method\nThe workflow applied to determine fallow land presence is shown in Figure 25. After the selection of parcels with an average annual crop type confidence below 35, the number and sequence of detected harvests and emergences in combination with the maximum fAPAR value are evaluated. The evaluation of this parameters is solely done within the reference year. When a harvest event is detected on a field it is evaluated if it occurs before a zone-specific allowed harvest date. This zonation aligns with the two zones used for the season delineation (see section Growing season delineation). The allowed harvest date is set before April 1st for fields located in zone 2 (see Table 5) and before May 1st for fields located in zone 1. If the harvest falls earlier, then this allowed harvest date is likely the harvest of the previous year sown secondary crop. In total 8 cases were defined to which the selected parcels could be classified as fallow land, as described below:\nNo emergence no harvest: There is no harvest nor emergence detected on the field. These are fields where there is clearly no agricultural activity, and they can thus be considered as fallow.\nHarvest: There is only one harvest event detected on the field and it occurs before the allowed harvest date. Since there is only one harvest that can be associated with a previous year secondary crop and no emergences or harvests are detected after the allowed harvest date the field is considered as fallow.\nEmergence: There is only one emergence detected on the field, since there is no harvest detected on the field, the emergence can be associated to fallow vegetation emerging on the field.\nHarvest-Emergence: One harvest date is detected before the allowed harvest date followed by an emergence. The harvest can be associated with a previous year secondary crop and the emergence can be associated to fallow vegetation emerging on the field.\nEmergence-Harvest: An emergence is followed by a harvest event and the length between these two events is at least 252 days (i.e., 9 months). The emergence can be associated with fallow vegetation emerging on the field, a harvest after 9 months is allowed since fallow vegetation can die back in winter period which can be falsely detected as a harvest.\nHarvest-Harvest: There are two harvests detected on the field before the allowed harvest date and the maximum fAPAR after the second harvest is below 0.35. In this case the harvest can be associated with a previous year secondary crop followed by a period of bare soil/very sparse fallow vegetation growth, the field is therefore considered as fallow.\nHarvest-Harvest-Emergence: In the case two harvest events follow each other closely (i.e., they are less than or equal to sixty days apart) and an emergence follows these harvests. In this case the harvests can be associated with a previous year secondary crop followed by a period of fallow vegetation emergence, the field is therefore considered as fallow.\nEmergence-Emergence: There are two emergences detected on the field but the maximum fAPAR value stays below 0.35. These fields have bare soil/very sparse fallow vegetation growth and are therefore considered as fallow.\n\n\n\nFigure 25: Workflow for fallow land presence classification. With CP: cropping pattern, CTYCL: confidence value of CTY layer. For the Metzger based environmental zonation see Table 5.\n\n\nFor details on the calculation of the Fallow Land Presence Confidence Layer (FLPCL) please refer to section\nFallow duration\nThe Fallow Land Duration (FLD) layer is defined as the sum of the yearly FLD over the last fiveyears period. The yearly fallow land duration is calculated as follows:\n➢ If a harvest date determines the start of the fallow land period, the length starts at that date until the end of the year.\n➢ If the harvest defines the end of the fallow land period, the length starts at the first day of the year until the harvest date.\n➢ If there is no harvest detected, the length is set to 365 days.\n\n\n3.6.5.5 Cropping Seasons\nThe Cropping Seasons (CL) layers provide some information on the crop type rotation over a three-year period or within a single reference year and consist of the following two layers:\n\nCropping Seasons Yearly (CSY)\nCropping Season Types over three years (CST)\n\nThe CSY layer establishes the number of growing seasons in one year (max. 2) for each selected field used in CP layers generation (only annual crops) and excluding fallow land. If both a secondary season and an annual crop type are identified, it will be counted as two growing seasons. If no secondary season falls within the seasonal limits, but it is classified as an annual crop type, it will be counted as one growing season for that year. In all other scenarios, it will be classified as having no cropping season within the reference year.\nThe CST layer is solely based on the CTY layer and only considers the annual crop type labels for counting crop rotation. For each reference period of three years, this layer is generated by considering the two years prior to the end of the reference period. As a consequence, the layer is only available from the reference period P2017-2019 onward. During any three-year reference period, the number of unique crop type labels is counted and can range from 1 to 3. Permanent crop labels are not included in the count, and if all three years consist of permanent crops, a value of zero will be assigned. There is one exception to the counting of crop type labels:\nIf the unclassified arable crop land label appears in any of the three years, it will be excluded from the count to avoid the risk of double counting the same crop type. If the entire period is classified as unclassified arable crop land, the count will be set to one.\n\n\n3.6.5.6 Encountered issues and known limitations\nA limitation of the Fallow Land (FL) layers is that only a subset of fields is considered for fallow land evaluation. Therefore, fallow fields that are not covered by the annual crop type masked parcel delineation product will not be examined and therefore not detected. Furthermore, reference data on fallow land is scarce and often a harmonized definition of fallow land is absent, which makes it hard to evaluate the product. Therefore, it was decided to work with some thematic rules that fit with the expected behavior of fallow land.\nThe expert rules are defined to determine crop seasonality (section Section 3.6.3.3) for most cases. However, there are still some specific cases that may not be addressed by the seasonal limits defined by the set of expert rules. In such cases, additional checks are needed to determine if the detected seasonality should be included in the CP layers. Some of these cases are discussed below.\nIn the case where a season does not correspond with any main season in the reference year, it is verified if there is still a season onset after the anticipated period of emergence for spring crops and a harvest event before the conclusion of the reference year. By applying this rule, the seasonality of vegetables that are planted late in the season are included. However, most of these cases involve fallow land with minimal seasonality and are categorized under fallow land layers (see section Section 3.6.5.4).\nIn the case where multiple spring crops are cultivated on a field, the first detected season is considered as the main season and the second one as the secondary season. In the case two secondary crop seasons occur after the main season, the first one is selected as secondary season. Other exceptions can occur but are not described due to their rare occurrence.\nOverall, the applied expert rules cover the most common seasonalities of annual crops, but some limitations exist. For example, in case of too short growing season lengths, some vegetables could be excluded from CP layers generation. However, shortening the allowed seasonal length would include much more expectations in the CP layers, leading to a less reliable product. Moreover, that the shorter the season the more errors could occur in the emergence and harvest detection, resulting in errors in the seasonal delineation.\nIn the case of double cropping seasons, there are instances where the seasonal labelling conflicts with the crop type label in the CTY layer. For instance, if a winter cereal is followed by maize, the CTY label might classify it as maize, while the season delineation designates the winter cereal season as the main season. This situation is more likely to occur in the southern regions of Europe where the climate allows for double cropping. In these areas, it is also possible for the harvest of winter cereals to coincide with the secondary crop harvest. In such cases, it becomes challenging to differentiate between winter cereals and secondary crops, leading to the possibility of the secondary crop being considered the main season. However, if a spring main crop signal is detected subsequently, it will be recognized as the main season.\nIn addition to the challenges associated with labeling seasons, issues may arise from the emergence and harvest detection processes themselves. For some specific crops like sunflowers, it is observed that often the seasonal signal is too subtle (Figure 26) to allow any harvest detection. This limitation has been particularly noted during the growing season of 2019 in southern Spain. No training data on this specific crop in this area is available to be able to improve the harvest detection algorithm.\n\n\n\nFigure 26: Example of CropSAR fAPAR signal for a sunflower field in southern Spain in 2019. The black lines show the detected emergence dates within the time series.\n\n\nAdditionally, in certain scenarios, consecutive emergence events without a corresponding harvest event in between, or vice versa occur. To address these situations, additional rules based on a bare soil indicator are developed to be able to select the correct emergence or harvest dates for linking seasons. However, some cases may still lead to the selection of incorrect emergence or harvest dates, resulting in outliers in seasonal length (either too short or excessively long) or even seasons that fall outside the allowed season boundaries. This issue is particularly prevalent when a secondary crop is planted immediately after the main crops harvest, or when the delineated parcel is a multi-cropped field, leading to emergence/harvest signals that reflect this multi-cropping behavior. Furthermore, in northern regions of Europe where a permanent snow cover occurs before main crops are harvested, the harvest may not be accurately detected, in these cases it impossible to identify any season even when crop cultivation does occur.\nFinally, some limitations in the CP layers arise from the filtering of annual crops based on the HRL CTY classification. Specifically, if a field is delineated but not classified as annual cropland in the CTY layer, no CP information is generated for that field—even in cases where annual cropping activity may actually be present. Conversely, false positives in the CTY annual crop classification can introduce artefacts into the CP layers by triggering extraction where no actual annual crop exists.\nOn the other hand, some annual cropland pixels in the CTY layer lack corresponding field delineations, resulting in missing CP outputs. At the Pan-European scale, approximately 10% of pixels classified as annual crops do not intersect with any delineated field and therefore cannot be assigned CP information. This loss is primarily due to two factors:\n\n5% is due to pixel-level misalignment at field boundaries, regions with more small and elongated fields will have more data loss.\nThe remaining 5% stems from larger spatial mismatches between the extent of CTY classified annual crop areas and the delineated field geometries. These discrepancies are most pronounced for crop types with lower classification accuracy—such as fresh vegetables, other cereals, and unclassified arable crops.\n\nIn contrast, for other (and most common) annual crop classes, around 95% of pixels are successfully aligned with the delineated field boundaries, ensuring reliable CP generation for these key crop types. For these crop types, the pixel misalignment at the field border is the main reason for this 5% loss of CP output."

    "text": "2 Cropland\n\nCropland is the main food production area. It includes both, intensively managed ecosystems and multifunctional areas supporting many semi-natural and natural species along with food production (lower intensity management). It comprises regularly or recently cultivated agricultural, horticultural and domestic habitats and agro-ecosystems with significant coverage of natural vegetation (agricultural mosaics) (Maes et. al., 2013).\nMAES categorizes croplands in three main groups:\n\nArable Land\nPermanent Crops\nHeterogeneous agricultural areas\n\nArable Land is land under a rotation system used for annually harvested plants and fallow lands. The land is permanently or not irrigated. It includes cereals, oil seed plants, vegetables, beets, fodder and flooded crops such as rice and other inundated croplands.\nPermanent crops are surfaces that are not under a rotation system but last for many seasons and need not to be replanted after harvest. Included are ligneous crops of standard cultures for fruit production such as extensive fruit orchards, olive groves, chestnut groves, walnut groves, shrub orchards such as vineyards and some specific low-system orchard plantation, espaliers and climbers. In the case of irrigated permanent crops, the qualification of irrigation prevails over permanent, thus, all the irrigated permanent crops are classified as 2.1.1.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land.\nHeterogeneous agricultural areas comprise surfaces where several categories are mixed. This may be either annual crops associated with permanent crops on the same parcel or annual crops cultivated under forest trees. Moreover, also combinations of annual crops, meadows and/or permanent crops mixed with natural vegetation or natural areas belong to this class.\nSpecific decision rules have been stabilised to distinct different types of heterogeneous agricultural areas:\n\nAnnual crops associated or in mosaic with permanent crops (vineyards, olives groves and non-irrigated fruits trees) in parcels &lt; 0.5 has. →2.3.1.0 Annual crops associated with permanent crops.\nMosaic or association of arable land and permanent crops in parcels &lt; 0.5 has. →2.3.2.0 Complex cultivation patterns.\nMix of arable land and pastures → 2.3.2.0 Complex cultivation patterns.\nCrops (annual/permanent/irrigated/non-irrigated) and mosaic of crops and pastures in mosaic or invaded by natural vegetation (agricultural area &gt; 75% and presence of parcels) → 2.3.3.0 Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation.\nAgro-forestry landscapes in specific locations → 2.3.4.0 Agro-forestry.\n\nThis category includes:\n\n2.1 Arable land\n\n2.1.1 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land\n\n2.1.1.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land\n\n\n2.1.2 Greenhouses\n\n2.1.2.0 Greenhouses\n\n\n\n2.2 Permanent crops\n\n2.2.1 Vineyards, fruit trees and berry plantations\n\n2.2.1.0 Vineyards, fruit trees and berry plantations\n\n\n2.2.2 Olive groves\n\n2.2.2.0 Olive groves\n\n\n\n2.3 Heterogeneous agricultural area\n\n2.3.1 Annual crops associated with permanent crops\n\n2.3.1.0 Annual crops associated with permanent crops\n\n\n2.3.2 Complex cultivation patterns\n\n2.3.2.0 Complex cultivation patterns\n\n\n2.3.3 Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation\n\n2.3.3.0 Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation\n\n\n2.3.4 Agro-forestry\n\n2.3.4.0 Agro-forestry (Mediterranean Areas) \n\n\n\n2.1.1.0 Arable Irrigated and Non-Irrigated Land\nThis class includes the following land cover/land use types: non-irrigated arable land; irrigated arable land and rice fields; and complex patterns of irrigated and non-irrigated arable land.\n\nClass 2.1.1.0 Type A: Non-Irrigated Arable Land\n\n\nDefinition\nAll kind of crops like cereals, legumes, fodder crops, root crops and fallow land. Includes flower and tree (nurseries) cultivation and vegetables (e.g. asparagus), whether open field or under plastic sheets.

    "text": "3 Woodland and Forest\n\n\n\n\n\nThe woodland and forest classes are mainly dominated by woody vegetation of various ages or by succession of climax vegetation types (MAES et al. 2013). The interpretation is done according to FAO (2000) with tree cover &gt;10%, MMU of 0.5 ha and trees able to reach 5 m height in-situ at maturity. Young natural stands and all plantations established for forestry purposes, which have yet to reach a crown density of 10% or tree height of 5 m, are also included as forest. These areas normally are part of the forest area although temporarily unstocked because of human intervention or natural reasons but which are expected to revert to forest.\nForest further comprises:\n\nnurseries and seed orchards that constitute an integral part of the forest;\nforest roads;\ncleared tracts &lt; 0.5 ha;\nfirebreaks and other small open areas &lt; 0.5 ha;\nforest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas with an area of more than 0.5 ha and width of more than 10 m (which goes beyond the FAO Forest definition of 20 m);\nplantations primarily used for forestry purposes, including rubber wood plantations and cork oak stands.\n\nLand predominantly used for agricultural practices is excluded. Excluded is also land with:\n\neither a crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of 5-10% of trees able to reach a height of 5m at maturity in situ;\na crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than 10% of trees not able to reach a height of 5m at maturity in situ (e.g. dwarf or stunted trees);\nshrub or bush cover of more than 10 percent is not accounted as Forest.\n\nThe differentiation between broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest is in accordance with CLC interpretation guideline and HR Forest definition.\nBroadleaved forest: Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where broadleaved species predominate and represent more than 75% of the pattern.\nConiferous forest: Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where coniferous species predominate and represent more than 75% of the pattern.\nMixed forest: Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where neither broadleaved nor coniferous species predominate. The share of coniferous or broad-leaved species does not exceed 75% in the canopy closure.\nThe definition of Woodland and Forest is mainly oriented along aggregated EUNIS habitat classes.\nForest type interpretation might be problematic in locations with sunny slopes or in hilly regions with shady slopes.\nFire breaks will be classified according to their current land covers.\nThis category includes:\n\n3.1 Broadleaved forest\n\n3.1.1 Natural & semi-natural broadleaved forest\n\n3.1.1.0 Natural & semi-natural broadleaved forest\n\n\n3.1.2 Highly artificial broadleaved plantations\n\n3.1.2.0 Highly artificial broadleaved plantations\n\n\n\n3.2 Coniferous forest\n\n3.2.1 Natural & semi natural coniferous forest\n\n3.2.1.0 Natural & semi natural coniferous forest\n\n\n3.2.2 Highly artificial coniferous plantations\n\n3.2.2.0 Highly artificial coniferous plantations\n\n\n\n3.3 Mixed forest\n\n3.3.1 Natural & semi natural mixed forest\n\n3.3.1.0 Natural & semi natural mixed forest\n\n\n3.3.2 Highly artificial mixed plantations\n\n3.3.2.0 Highly artificial mixed plantations\n\n\n\n3.4 Transitional woodland and scrub\n\n3.4.0 Transitional woodland and scrub\n\n3.4.0.0 Transitional woodland and scrub\n\n\n\n3.5 Lines of trees and scrub\n\n3.5.0 Lines of trees and scrub\n\n3.5.0.0 Lines of trees and scrub\n\n\n\n3.6 Damaged forest\n\n3.6.0 Damaged forest\n\n3.6.0.0 Damaged forest \n\n\n\n3.1.1.0 Natural & Semi Natural Broadleaved Forest\nDefinition:\nThis type of forest comprises the tree species Fagus (EUNIS G1.6), deciduous or semi-deciduous thermophiles types like Quercus species and Carpinus orientalis, Castanea sativa or Ostrya carpinifolia (EUNIS G1.7). Moreover, Quercus robur or Quercus petraea on acid soils (G1.8), non-riverine/swamp forest composed of Betula, Populus tremula or Sorbus aucuparia (G1.9) species; Quercus robur, Ulmus spp., Fraxinus excelsior, Tilia cordata or Acer platanoides (G1.A) and woods dominated by Alnus (G1.B).\nAlso forest on wet ground (e.g. moors, swamps, marshes, fens or peat bogs). On non-acid peat the class is comprised of the tree species Alnus, Populus, Quercus swamp woods (EUNIS G1.4). On wet acid peat Betula pubescens or rarely Alnus glutinosa (EUNIS G1.5) are predominate.\nIn addition, this class comprises broadleaved sclerophyllous or lauriphyllous evergreen trees and palms, which are characteristic for the Mediterranean and warm-temperate humid zones (EUNIS class G2). In these regions broadleaved evergreen forest is predominate and represents more than 75% of the pattern.\n\n\n\nBroadleaved forest (beech), Bavaria, Germany. Credits: M.

    "text": "4 Grassland\n\nThe grassland classes are areas dominated by grassy vegetation of two kinds –managed pastures and (semi-) natural (extensively managed) grasslands3. Generally grasses (basically graminacea plants but can include tall forbs, rushes and sedges, mosses and lichens) covers more than 30% of the soils (EUNIS description), called below Crown Cover Density (C.C.D.).\nAccording to Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive, European natural grasslands are limited to alpine meadows (as Alpine, Pyrenean and Oro-Iberian grasslands) and other located grasslands.\nIn this sense, MAES level 2 natural grasslands are considered as natural and semi-natural grasslands and managed grasslands are agricultural grasslands. The main characteristics of agricultural grassland are the high human influence, basically cultivation and visible parcel structure in EO data.\nSemi-natural grasslands are frequently associated with trees and scrubs. These grasslands should be managed to maintain their grass coverage, basically by cutting out scrubs manually or mechanically. The combination of trees and grasslands is also present in many locations in Europe (in alluvial areas; in wooded hay meadows; due forest clearing, etc.). Dehesas and other wooded pastures, as Fennoscandinavian wooded pastures, are included in MAES Croplands class (agroforestry systems located in South Western Europe) or woodland and forest (in the case of forest pastures).\nThis category includes:\n\n4.1 Managed grassland\n\n4.1.0 Managed grassland\n\n4.1.0.0 Managed grassland\n\n\n\n4.2 Natural & semi natural grassland\n\n4.2.1 Semi-natural grassland\n\n4.2.1.0 Semi-natural grassland\n\n\n4.2.2 Alpine and sub-alpine natural grassland\n\n4.2.2.0 Alpine and sub-alpine natural grassland \n\n\n\n4.1.0.0 Managed Grassland\nDefinition:\nManaged grasslands are considered intensively managed areas for the production of grass. From a land use point of view, in the case of these agricultural grasslands, grass is a crop in the same way as cereals or others. Managed grasslands could be divided into improved and semi-improved grasslands according to their management.\nAgricultural grasslands occupy huge areas in the lowlands of the European plain and in United Kingdom and Ireland, where they have a longer growing season due to climatic conditions, leaving dryer areas for arable crops. In many areas, arable land and agricultural grasslands are mixed.\nThis category corresponds to 231 Corine class (Pastures). According to the statistical analysis of Corine Land Cover 2006 data, pastures (231 classes) occupied 66% of more than 60.000.000 ha considered as grasslands (classes 231-pastures- and 321 –natural grasslands-).\nThe main characteristics of an ideally improved agricultural grassland farmland are 4\n\nThe grass farmland is dominated by selected grasses, especially perennial, and the crop is very dense. In early spring, the grassland is often fertilized by the farmer. These grass farmland areas are chlorophyll rich almost all year long and do not contain or contain very little dead biomass.\nIntensive cutting and grazing is done during the grass growing season (usually from April to September).\nThe grass could be cut and preserved for winter feeding. The grass for silage must be harvested in an optimum moment.\nSome farmers spread the grass by mower to achieve a better wilt, with the objective to remove excessive moisture for silage. This process could generate rows in the land due to accumulation of grasses. In many cases, this makes grasses undistinguishable from arable land using remote sensing techniques.\nFertilizers are applied.\nAgricultural grassland could be reseeded.\nUsually there are farm buildings (silages; covered yards; stables, etc.) around.\nOften/mainly used for grazing.\nImproved grassland could be included in rotation. In many countries and in European regulations (as EC Regulation 796/2004 related to EU agricultural policy) an area is considered as “permanent grassland” if the land is covered by grasses during at least five years.\n\nPer definition, there is no tree or scrub presence in improved grasslands\nIn between the intensively used grass farmland or in specific regions (as the bocage landscape in France), there can be plots of less intensive or extensive grassland, e.g. mowed only once a year. This type of grasslands (lowland and mountain hay meadows) could be considered as semi-improved grasslands (prairie in France; prado in Spain). Like in mountain alpine meadows, the percentage of wild floral species can increase. These grasslands can content trees and scrubs, especially trees walls around the parcels.\n\n\n\nManaged (improved) grasslands in Friesland (The Netherlands). Credit: European Union, 2012.

Alonso\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic representation of managed (semi-improved) grasslands\n\n\nManaged grasslands are discriminated from arable land using Landsat and VHR images, specific color and structure patterns (arable land parcels are generally more angular in shape than pastures and the texture is smooth) and the identification of cultivation tracks, but a certain grade of confusion between two classes is expected. Arable land, in Continental; Mediterranean and Nordic environments, typically appears on flat lowland soils with clay / fine sediment and few blocks. They are therefore generally more angular in shape than pastures and the texture is smooth.\n\n\n\nManaged grassland in Scandinavia. Borders to arable land. SPOT-5 image.* (*1/2/3 Band Combination).

Here are also included marginal grasslands: abandoned crop invaded by grasses; areas near roads and other infrastructures; abandoned dumping sites, etc.\nSemi natural grasslands include both dry grasslands and mesic grasslands:\n\nDry Grasslands: The EUNIS definition of dry grassland is: “Well drained or dry lands dominated by grass or herbs, mostly not fertilized and with low productivity. Included are [Artemisia] steppes. Excluded are dry Mediterranean lands with shrubs of other genera where the shrub cover exceeds 10%; these are listed as garrigue (F6)6.”\n\n\nThe Annex I of Habitat Directive considers diverse grassland types as dry grasslands, from calcareous grasslands of central and western Europe, to steppes in Pannonic region or pseudo-steppes in Mediterranean areas. In all cases, these are grasslands located in less fertile soils, and are extensively managed (not ploughed and rarely fertilized) and used for livestock grazing. In Annex I this type of grasslands are considered as semi-natural.\nIn the Mediterranean Region, dry grasslands are considered by the Annex I of Habitat Directive as pseudo-steppes. They are characterized by their loss of greenness in summer-time and are devoted to livestock grazing. In Hungary and other countries we find steppes grasslands (known here as puszta), as part of the dry grasslands. Pannonian steppes are flat alluvial plains dominated by herbaceous plants extensively managed and strongly transformed by agriculture. Turkey is also dominated by the Eurasian steppe (Central Anatolia steppe; Easter Anatolia Montane Steppe and Ponto-Sarmatic steppes in the Black Sea region). Semi-natural dry grasslands are also present in salt steppes and in gypsum steppes across Europe. Mediterranean salt steppes (Limonietalia); Iberian gypsum vegetation (Gypsophiletalia) and Pannonic salt steppes and salt marshes are also considered as semi-natural grasslands. Nordic alvar grasslands are also included here. These grasslands are located in dry calcareous and limestone bedrocks, covered by snow in winter and subject to strong winds. Regularly clearing is necessary to avoid scrubs. Coastal grasslands as machairs (specific coastal old landscape present in dunes in western Ireland and Scotland) dominated by grasses are also included.\nIn the case of steppes (Anatolian steppe) and Mediterranean pseudo-steppes (dry Mediterranean grasslands), grasses and grass-like plants are mixed with patches of rocks and/or sparsely vegetated areas. These habitats (especially Anatolian steppes) are characterized by low biomass due to dry conditions and poor soils. In many cases these steppes suffer for over-grazing and erosion7. As results, especially during summer time, it is not feasibly the distinction using EO data between areas covered by grasses (MAES class 4. Grassland) and rocks and areas with sparsely vegetation (MAES class 6. Sparsely vegetated land). In this case has been adopted the concept of steppes and pseudo-steppes as an edaphic climax habitat dominated by grasses and grass-like plants but with a high presence of sparsely vegetated areas. In this sense, generalization rules are applied (inclusion as grassland patches of low vegetation biomass) in order to avoid an excessive mapping fragmentation.\nDry grassland in Atlantic and Continental regions are restricted to very located sites affected by poor soils conditions such as calcareous dry grasslands in Western Germany, grasslands located in chalk cliffs in Denmark, grassland located in karstic regions in the Balkans or Nordic alvars8.\n\n\n\nDry grassland with trees on the Franconian Alb (juniper heathland), Germany.

They are generally more fertile than dry grasslands (E1), and include sports fields and agriculturally improved and reseeded pastures”. In EUNIS habitat classification9, the habitats are separated according the presence of water: waterlogged (the water table at or above ground level for at least half of the year), permafrost (habitats where the soil is at a temperature of less than 0oC throughout the year) and other (always dry; mesic, moist or humid; only seasonally wet; regularly but infrequently flooded or occasionally flooded by extreme weather conditions but which are free-draining; wet but not waterlogged; permanent snow and ice.). Here we consider mesic grasslands as mesic and moist or humid grasslands. The separation between mesic grasslands and wetlands is that the latter are waterlogged or frequently flooded.\n\n\nTaken into account Annex I Habitat Directive and EUNIS classification following grasslands types are included here:\n\nSemi-natural humid meadows: wet pastures (including riverine meadows), Mediterranean alluvial meadows and Northern boreal alluvial meadows.\nMesophile grassland not included in 4.1.0.0 Managed grasslands, including abandoned hay meadows.\n\n\n\n\nSpontaneous grassland in Bieszczday district (Poland).

    "section": "7 Wetland",
    "text": "7 Wetland\n\nAccording to Article 1.1 of the Ramsar Convention25 (1971), wetlands are: “areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters”. This MAES class refers only to inland freshwater/saline wetlands.\nInland wetlands are predominantly water-logged specific plant and animal communities supporting water regulation and peat-related processes. This class includes natural or modified mires, bogs and fens, as well as peat extraction sites26 (MAES). Surfaces of temporary water are included in wetlands. According EUNIS guidelines (see table below), water-logged means the presence of the water table at or above ground level for at least half of the year.\nAdaptation of water interpretation in EUNIS27 and related RZ classes\n\n\n\n\n\nA decision criteria tree is established to clarify guideline distinctions between CODE Level 4 classes as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis category includes:\n\n7.1 Inland wetlands\n\n7.1.1 Inland marshes\n\n7.1.1.0 Inland marshes\n\n\n7.1.2 Peat bogs\n\n7.1.2.1 Exploited peat bog\n7.1.2.2 Unexploited peat bog\n\n\n7.2 Coastal wetlands\n\n7.2.1 Salt marshes\n\n7.2.1.0 Salt marshes\n\n\n7.2.2 Salines\n\n7.2.2.0 Salines\n\n\n7.2.3 Intertidal flats\n\n7.2.3.0 Intertidal flats \n\n\n\n7.1.1.0 Inland Marshes\nDefinition:\nInland wetlands without a direct connection to the open ocean with significant content of water, which is influenced by a certain seasonal fluctuation.\nThis category corresponds to 411 CORINE Land Cover class (Inland marshes). Both inland freshwater marshes and inland salt marshes are included in this class. They are created where saline ground water rises to the surface, or in endorheic basins.\nInland marshes appear with or without a vegetation coverage. The coverage usually consists of reeds. Reed is a common name for several tall, grass-like plants of wetlands and rivers. They are all members of the order Poales: Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Sparganiaceae, Typhacea or Restionaceae.\nReed in marshes groups basically two types of plants:\n\nSedges (Cyperaceae family) are monocotyledon plants with solid and triangular stems; 3-ranked leaves; with flowers, and lenticular or triangular fruits. Sedges are common in wet habitats, including marshes, and in tundra habitats.\nRushes (Juncaceae family) are monocotyledon plants with solid and mostly round stems; few leaves, only basal or reduced to sheaths; with flowers and fruits in capsules. Rushes are common in wet habitats.\n\nIf not covered by vegetation: basically mud areas and/or waterlogged grasses and grass-like plants will be mapped.\nInland salt marshes without vegetation are located predominantly in Pannonic region (Pannonic salt steppes), Turkey, in Mediterranean specific locations and in endorheic basins across Europe.\nThis category includes:\n\nMarshes (freshwater or salt) with or without vegetation (reeds) coverage.\nAreas where reeds are harvested.\nReed covered wetland along river sides\nIn Nordic conditions: includes non-grazed/mowed and non-peat producing wetlands. These areas normally have a vegetation of tall grasses and sedges.\nAreas flooded at least six months a year with low or no vegetation.\nGrasslands highly wet or flooded at least six months a year.\nBare soils as results of previous presence of water will be also included within this category.\nIt will be taken into account that the Baltic Sea has only brackish coastal waters, which qualify for inland freshwater marshes.\nLimestone mires.\nFloating vegetation.\nReed beds in saline marshes with coverage less than 30%.\n\nThis category excludes:\n\nFloating aquatic vegetation (species such as Nuphar spp., Nymphaea spp., Potamageton spp. and Lemna spp.) is not considered as reeds and is included in 8.2.

Therefore the position in the terrain is used for guidance. Areas directly adjacent to bigger rivers or lakes are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes when visual interpretation is insufficient. This is because of lower chances of peat production when oxygen from flowing water is supplied to the ecosystem as opposed to ecosystems adjacent to standing water.\nNon-peat producing wetlands with a low-growing vegetation of grasses and sedges are generally grazed/mowed. These areas are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes.\nNon-grazed/mowed and non-peat producing wetlands normally have a vegetation of tall grasses and sedges and are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes. Temporarily flooded areas with low grasses and sedges are included in 4.2.1.0 Semi-natural grassland (located in mesic environments).\n\nMethodological Advice:\n\nMain identification will be based on CORINE Land Cover class 4.1.1 and Soils Map of Europe.\nThe existing knowledge on locations of large inland salines (Southern Europe, Pannonian Region or Turkey) will be taken into account and their surrounding ecosystems will be analyzed in order to detect possible occurrences of salines in class 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes.\nThe dividing line between the wetland and water classes is difficult to define without the contribution of images of different dates during the same year (in order to take into account the seasonality). The HRL Water/Wetland Layers may help to identify the boundaries between those two classes, but it should be noted that the pixel size of HR Layers is 20m and the production is based on the analysis of imagery corresponding to different years (2006-2009-2012-2018), not to different seasons.\nOther important datasets to detect these boundaries are Natura 2000 Network and Wetland Ramsar Sites databases. They are particularly relevant in the Mediterranean area and are highly recommended to use in the detection of Wetland Areas and Areas of Special Concern.\nAny available ancillary or in-situ data sources will also be used.\n\n7.1.2.1 Exploited Peat Bog\nDefinition:\nOpen exploited peat producing wetlands that are not greatly affected by lakes, sea water or water from water courses.

MAES wetland class is visually interpreted and adjusted manually. Adjustments of delineation are made only where obvious errors in ancillary are discernible in visual interpretation. When typical mire/peat structures cannot be seen in the image, it is difficult to determine if an area is peat producing or not. Therefore the position in the terrain is used for guidance. Areas directly adjacent to bigger rivers or lakes are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes when visual interpretation is insufficient. This is because of lower chances of peat production when oxygen from flowing water is supplied to the ecosystem as opposed to ecosystems adjacent to standing water. Grazed areas from LPIS that overlap wetland from the Topographic map are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes.\n\n7.2.1.0 Salt Marshes\nDefinition:\nCoastal salt marshes, according to the EUNIS habitat description, are dominated by sediments and salt-tolerant stands of vegetation, occurring on the extreme upper shore of sheltered coasts and periodically covered by high tides. According to the definition of CLC class 5.2, Marine waters are oceanic and continental shelf waters, bays and narrow channels including sea lochs, fiords and straits.\nThe class salt marshes includes according to EUNIS following habitat types: salt marsh drift lines, upper salt marshes, mid-upper salt marshes and saline brackish reed, rush and sedge beds and littoral sediments not included in 7.2.3 Intertidal flats or 6.2.1 Beaches and dunes.\nThe Estuaries class (8.3.2) includes marine waters not included in class 8.4.0 Sea and ocean or other lagoons and coastal wetlands classes.\nVegetated low-lying coastal areas, above the high-tide line, susceptible to flooding by seawater. Often in the process of filling in, gradually being colonized by salt tolerant plants (saline reed beds). Salt marshes also appear without or less vegetation coverage.\nOn the date of the EO data of reference these areas may be covered or not by water. In this category, the entire marsh area will be considered as class 7.2.1, regardless if it is covered by water or not on the date of the image.\n\n\n\nSalt marshes with salt tolerant plants in Camargue (Southern France).

In those areas, land may be covered with shallow, slow-moving floodwater for days or even weeks as exceptional situations.

Coastal lagoons are vegetated (reed bed and salt marsh plants) or unvegetated.\nCORINE Land Cover 521 Coastal lagoons is adopted: “Stretches of salt or brackish water in coastal areas which are separated from the sea by a tongue of land or other similar topography. These water bodies can be connected to the sea at limited points, either permanently or for parts of the year only” .\nCoastal lagoons are considered as a water ecosystem composed by water and specific adapted vegetation (reed beds and marsh plants). Coastal lagoons also appear without or less vegetation coverage.\nThis category is relevant in Mediterranean coastal areas.

    "text": "4.1 Use case: Building height and sustainability (energy use and CO2-emissions)\nStudies show that the most efficient way to impact urban form and increase the built-up density, is by increasing the building height (Eirik Resch, 2016) (Yu, et al., 2022). The urban form and built-up density can be used as an indicator of building energy use. Increased density in urban areas can result in signifcant energy savings due to less energy demand for heating and cooling (Burak Güneralp, 2017). Building more compact cities has also been identified by the IPCC as an important mitigation measure for climate change, as it is related to reduced energy use per capita, primarily because of a decrease in energy used for transportation when inhabitants are able to walk or cycle to a larger extent, but also due to reduced energy use for heating and/or cooling (Burak Güneralp, 2017) (Eirik Resch, 2016) (Jiayu Li, 2022).\nThere is a relation between built-up density, building height and building energy use, and subsequently CO2-emissions due to for example heating, cooling, ventilation, and artificial lighting. Taller buildings with compact urban form suffer less heat loss than lower buildings in colder climates and high-rise buildings in warmer climates decrease the solar exposure on surrounding buildings, in suitably dense built-up areas, which may reduce the cost of cooling.

Population change over time could be used to model migration trends. Data on built-up area and population density can also give an indication of sustainability in the form of estimated amount of waste created and environmental ability to manage it, as well as the access to and availability of resources at the local level. (D.

    "text": "4.3 Use case: Informing urban planning and risks to human wellbeing\nUrbanisation and dense urban living could impact spreading of infectious diseases (Wu, 2017), building height could prove an indicator of this risk to human wellbeing, supporting plans and policies to mitigate such hazards.\nThe urban form influences the urban environment and socioeconomic activities which in turn have various effects on the urban environment in terms of for example changing land cover and urban functions and structures, which can impact for example human wellbeing. The urban form can also affect urban heat islands (UHI), greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, urban ecosystems, and public health. (Yu, et al., 2022) (Tian, 2019)\nBuilding height information in cities influence metrics such as the arise of UHI, and pedestrian ventilation and pollution dispersion. Knowledge about the building height and 3D-model of cities could prove a powerful tool to inform urban planning efforts aiming to improve human wellbeing, as well as inform studies on population distribution and CO2-emissions. (Yu, et al., 2022)\nIndoor environment can also be impacted by surrounding building height, causing acoustic and illumination effects that impact the health of building occupants, thus building height (and density) information can aid in neighborhood and building design to alleviate health problems caused by acoustic or visual discomfort. (Isabelle Y.S. Chan, 2018)\nBuilding height has been shown to affect Land Surface Temperature (LST) and air temperature (Tair) and varying building heights can contribute to better ventilation and pollution dispersion in densely built areas in cities (Bálint Papp, 2021) (Zander S. Venter, 2020). Both are indicators of urban heat and can indicate the cooling requirements of urban infrastructure, and thus the energy-use and carbon emissions (Zander S. Venter, 2020), as presented in section 4.1.\nLST is important for quantifying urban heat islands (UHI) (Zander S. Venter, 2020), and has been shown having a lower correlation (than building cover and vegetation cover and height) contributing to a higher LST in relatively low buildings (up to 9 m) and cooler climates (Alexander, 2021), but having a stronger correlation (than building density and vegetation coverage) and contributing to a lower LST in high rise buildings and warmer climates (Zhong Zheng, 2019).\nTair is largely influenced by urbanisation (Zander S. Venter, 2020) and LST (Alexander, 2021), and can be predicted with building height. Both LST and Tair can be used as an indicator for human heat exposure and UHI, but Tair may be the better indicator for this specific use and can additionally be used as a determinant of urban cooling, (Zander S. Venter, 2020). This information can be used to establish policy instruments and/or national plans to prepare for and adapt to extreme heat waves and the health risks and impact this may have on the urban population. The information on building height and the relation to Tair can also be used for climate change adaptation measures in cities, to quantify the value of eco-systems services and inform nature-based solutions.\nAir temperature, Tair, is linearly connected with varying building height, and building height is one variable to predict Tair, and can significantly reduce city ventilation and thus can indirectly affect pollution dispersion (Zander S. Venter, 2020), (Bálint Papp, 2021). High-rise buildings tend to decrease natural ventilation (Burak Güneralp, 2017). Building height can also be used as an indicator of populations density and quantification of emissions (D. Ehrlich, 2018). The temperature of block surfaces, affected by building heights and density mainly when these factors combined contribute to a decreased solar radiation reaching the block surface, also affect the temperature experienced by pedestrians, wind patterns and heat loss (Yunhao Chen, 2020).\nThese indicators and information indicate the importance of open-source building height modelling for input into urban planning for human health and wellbeing and to facilitate nature-based solutions to climate change adaptation."

The measured impact of fast-onset hazards on the built environment is largely depending on the built-up area as the main indicator of impact is measured in casualties (D. Ehrlich, 2018). The more precise the measurement of disaster impact is, the better the estimations of aid and emergency services can be.\nEmergency response to man-made, meterorological or geophysical hazards leading to unfolding disasters or humanitarian emergencies could also largely benefit from population density data. The information can aid in assessment of damage severity and number of people affected, for example with the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (Copernicus EMS) or similar services. Assessment of damage can also provide useful and updated information to resource allocation, specific and exposed assets or population groups such as transport networks and route design, utilities and industry as well as settlements.

More precise data on building density is also essential for an improved modeling and assessment of population distribution, air pollution and emissions, carbon footprint, energy demand, and traffic patterns (Thomas Esch, 2022)."

The EU-OECD have developed a methodology to define high-density clusters (also called urban centres), cities and FUAs in a consistent way across countries. Using population density and travel-to-work flows as key information, a FUA consists of a densely inhabited city and a surrounding area (commuting zone) whose labour market is highly integrated with the city (OECD 2012). For the detailed definition of urban centres, cities and FUAs please refer to “The EU-OECD definition of a functional urban area” (Dijkstra, 2019).\nThe UA BBHM product is a set of layers in GeoTIFF raster format containing building height information for 870 European cities and urban centres, located in Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) accross the EEA38 area, covering an approximate area of around 75 000 km2.\nThe UA BBHM is based on VHR imagery for the defined areas of intereste (AoI) from the reference year 2012, or as close as possible to this year, see chapter 6.2.1 for details. From these a Digital Surface Model (DSM), a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital Height Model (DHM) are created, with which the BBHM product can finally be derived.\nThe UA BBHM product has a MMU of 10 x 10 m and is projected to the European reference system EPSG:3035.

These updated FUAs have been labelled “L”+number to indicate which version of FUA delineation was used (e.g. L1, L2, etc.). In the previous release of the UA BBHM this labelling was kept, but for this new UA BBHM release it has been removed. Thus, for a user who has downloaded UA BBHM files for any of the capital cities from the previous release, the files are named as for the example of Vienna (WIEN) in Figure 5‑2. As can be seen from the example, this was the second FUA version of Vienna, indicated by the “L2”. For this new release the downloaded folder names will not have this LX, where X indicates a number, see Figure 5‑3.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑2 Example of naming of previous releases’ .zip-file\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑3 Example of naming of current releases\n\n\nRegarding versioning there are a few aspects to take into consideration:\nIn the first release there were two versions: version “v010” (original version) and version “v020” if the city had been re-mapped due to some area extension, see Figure 5‑4. There were six cities with version “v020”. In this new release these cities will display version “v030”.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑4 Example of cities with areas extension, and the subsequent version ”v020”\n\n\nThe remaining 25 capital cities that were a part of the previous release have not been updated for building height values but were subjected to a remapping of “0” values into “NoData”, to be aligned with this new release. In this case these cities will display version “v020”.\nAll newly added cities for this release will display version “v010”.\n\n\n5.2.2 Dataset\nIn this folder, a raster file in GeoTIFF format is stored. This is a layer that shows the heights of the buildings, with a data type of 16-bit unsigned integer (UInt16) with LZW compression, since a negative height value on buildings is not expected. It presents a MMU of 10 x 10 meters, and it is projected to the European terrestrial reference system “ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA)” with EPSG:3035. All information that does not correspond to a building height value is classified as NoData, with a value in the data matrix of 65535. These characteristics allow the GeoTIFF file to occupy a very small size (as compared to the first release that also included “0” values). It was decided to remove the zeros because we could not distinguish a “0” that was a measured value or a “0” that referred to vegetation, water or roads (masked out).\nWhen the user opens the GeoTIFF file in a GIS software, it will be displayed using a default grayscale ramp, as the product does not have a default color ramp or style defined.\n\n\n5.2.3 Metadata\nA metadata file is created for each BBHM file, containing the information of the product. The information refers to data identification, classification of spatial data, geographic reference, temporal reference, quality and validity, conformity, constraints related to access and use and responsible organisation. These files were created according to the EEA metadata INSPIRE compliant requirements guideline.\n\n\n5.2.4 Pixel Based Information\nThe Pixel Based information data includes an ESRI shapefile layer, together with its associated files, showing the information and spatial distribution of the VHR satellite, or LiDAR, image pairs used for the construction of the Digital Height Model (DHM).\nEach file details the images conforming each false stereo pair. The information is subdivided into polygonal entities. When one of the polygonal entities is selected the accompanying attribute table can be shown, see example in Figure 5‑5. The attribute table shows the properties of the images that compose the image pair used to evaluate the building height in that specific area; like the image ID, the date of image acquisition, sensor used (vehicle, see Table 5‑2), percentage of cloud cover, the value of nadir angle, sun elevation, and value of azimuthal angle. These values are essential for the calculation of the DSM using optical satellite photogrammetry technology, see chapter 6.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑5 Shapefile attribute table with the main characteristics of sensor images used\n\n\nThe previous example is true for any of the 845 new cities added or capital cities remapped in this release, i.e. the 25 capital cities which were not remapped from the previous release will not have a folder called Pixel Based Info in the downloaded .zip-file. These 25 capital cities from the previous release have been included without remapping, however they have undergone a reprocessing as described in chapter 6.6.\nTable 5‑2 shows the name and description of the different sensors used.\n\nTable 5‑2 List of sensors used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensor\nDescription\nResolution\nSpectral Bands\n\n\n\n\nWV-01\nWorldview 1\n0.5\nPAN\n\n\nWV-02\nWorldview 2\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nWV-03\nWorldview 3\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nGE-01\nGeoEye 01\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nQB-02\nQuickbird 02\n0.65\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nIK\nIkonos\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 QC\nThe QC report is a report in PDF format with the results obtained after the execution of the quality control.

    "section": "6.1 Defining and refining the AoIs",
    "text": "6.1 Defining and refining the AoIs\nThe AoI (Area of Interest) for the BBHM represents the urban areas of each city or urban centre. It is the combination of Urban Audit cities from 20181 and urban centres from 20112 (also called high-density clusters) available at GISCO3 servers.\nThe two files were merged and added to the high-density clusters of West Balkans and Turkey delineated in the framework of a previous project since West Balkans and Turkey are not part of GISCO. It represents approximately an area of 198.000km². For simplicity reasons it was decided to call it the City Perimeter described in more detail in 6.1.1.\nThis initial AoI had to be refined. The process of refining the initial AoI is described below and illustrated in Figure 6‑2.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑2 Flowchart of the AoI refinement process\n\n\n\n6.1.1 City Perimeter (City + High density clusters polygon)\nThe City Perimeter is the outer delineation of the merging of the Urban Audit cities for 2018 and “high-density clusters” (also called “urban centres”) for 2011.\nAll these files originate from different dates but were the best available at the time. The Urban Audit cities are from 2018, the High Density Custers from 2011, while the UA underlying LC/LU data is from 2012 and the satellite information are based on 2012 data, or as close as possible to 2012, see further in chapter 6.2.1.\nThis AoI was used during the searching of satellite images for the DSMs generation.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑3 Left: City administrative area (purple) and high density cluster (black line inside purple field) of Leuven. Right: City administrative area and high-density cluster merged into City Perimeter layer\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 UA Urban Areas Classes\nThe second step in refining the AoI for the BBHM product is to select the relevant LC/LU classes from Urban Atlas where buildings are expected to be found, i.e., any classes belonging to codes 1XXXX, but not for example forests or pastures or any of the classes with codes 2XXXX-5XXXX. For reference, the nomenclature of Urban Atlas LC/LU product can be found in pages 19-21 of the Nomenclature guideline4.\nThe selected classes from the Urban Atlas representing urban areas can be seen below:\n\nAirports\nDiscontinuous dense urban fabric (S.L.: 50% - 80%)\nDiscontinuous low density urban fabric (S.L.: 10% - 30%)\nDiscontinuous medium density urban fabric (S.L.: 30% - 50%)\nDiscontinuous very low density urban fabric (S.L.: &lt; 10%)\nContinuous urban fabric (S.L.: &gt; 80%)\nIsolated structures\nIndustrial, commercial, public, military and private units\nPort areas\nGreen urban areas\nRailways\nSports and leisure facilities\n\nThis AoI (UA Urban Areas Classes) is used to clip the City Perimeter AoI, to represents areas where buildings are expected within the defined City Perimeter AoI.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑4 Comparison between City Perimeter (purple) and UA Urban Areas Classes layer (red)\n\n\nA buffer of 50 m is added around the borders to avoid border errors, see Figure 6‑5.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑5 Selected UA Urban Areas classes, city of Leuven (Belgium). Left: Final result of selected classes. Right: Example of a buffer area applied to expand the original margin.\n\n\nThe result is the UA Urban Areas classes + 50 m mapped within the City Perimeter boundaries. The polygons within this shapefile are then checked for small gaps, which are filled.\nWhenever UA LC/LU classes were missing within the City Perimeter of a selected city, these missing polygons were manually created and added. In some cases, the same UA Urban Areas classes were included in two separate cities. Depending on factors like distance between the cities, FUA codes and city codes in UA, these cities have either been considered one and the same (when close together for example) or separate cities (for example when there is a big distance between them, or the cities have different city codes in the UA).\nThe previous release of the BBHM included 38 European capital cities. These areas have not been remapped in this release, except for in cases where new areas have been added to the city’s FUA (a total of 13).\nThe total number of cities mapped in this release of the BBHM is 845.\n\n\n6.1.3 UA roads, water, and wetland\nAn additional shapefile extracted from UA is created including the UA classes of: Other roads and associated land, Water or Wetlands, see Figure 6‑6. This layer is useful to eliminate pixels that do not represent buildings.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑6 Urban roads, city of Leuven (Belgium). Left: Land uses (orange), UA Urban Areas Classes. Right: Example of class selection. (red).\n\n\nThe following example shows the different AoIs applied for the city of Münster, located in the west of Germany. Figure 6‑6 shows the three types of AoIs used in the refinement process Anything in the City Perimeter AoI which does not correspond to buildings is shown in red (will be given the value NoData in the final dataset); the UA Urban Areas Classes AoI are shown in orange (numerical values in dataset if building is present), and the UA roads, water, and wetland AoI is shown in pink.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑7 Examples of the AoIs for Münster, Germany. NoData (red), UA Urban Areas Classes (orange) and Urban Road (pink)\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Building Footprints\nBuilding Footprints represent the individual constructions that were present in 2012 within the Urban Atlas. The Building Footprints layer is obtained by applying an elaborated Python algorithm to the selected high resolution satellite images, which leverages a semantic segmentation model to extract and separate individual buildings in densely compacted areas. The algorithm considers the pixel information of the multispectral and panchromatic images.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture is used for semantic segmentation of building footprints from multispectral images, and to label every pixel in the images. After each convolution layer an extra batch normalization layer will be added to avoid any extreme values, reducing sensitivity towards initial weights and reduce overfitting of the model.\nBasic morphological operation on binary data will be used for noise removal. Thereafter a Local Maxima approach will be used to separate connected buildings, by allocating local maxima and higher weight to the larger area out of building and connection. The Local Maxima is used as input source/sink in a watershed algorithm used for image segmentation. Each building obtained from this process is given a unique index for further processing. The result is a raster.\nFor areas with dense vegetation, the algorithm might generate some confusing pixels. Therefore, a review of the Building Footprints layer has been carried out for areas with dense vegetation. Hereafter a quality control is conducted to verify that no buildings or constructions were excluded, and to discard false positives.\nThe raster is then vectorized. Spatial references and coordinate systems are preserved at every step and are transferred to vector file for correct overlaying. While converting from raster to vector, the output has a lot of vertices and noises. The vector is then simplified using Douglas-Peucker algorithm (David Douglas, 1973) to help preserve the overall geometry of the shape while simplifying number of vertices. Basic attributes like area, perimeter and elevation of the buildings were automatically added. Finally, minimum bounding box was used and saved.\nThe resulting Building Footprints was later used in the BBHM production as a mask to separate areas with height data values from areas with no height data values, see chapter 6.6. If there is building footprints data available in the area, this will be considered for refining the AoI of each city.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑8 Building footprints for the city of Leuven (Belgium)"

    "section": "6.2 Data pre-processing",
    "text": "6.2 Data pre-processing\nThe main input data is comprised of VHR satellite images from 2012, on which the different algorithms for producing the DSM and DTM will be executed, see chapter 6.3 and 6.4. The different sensors used for the VHR image collection are, as shown in Table 5‑2, Worldview 1, 2, 3, Quickbird, Ikonos and Geoeye. The aim is to acquire stereoscopic pair images, overlapping imagery acquired from different locations, to produce a 3D model for the refined AoIs.\nThe worldwide coverage of stereoscopic pair images is very limited, as it is not the most common and easy data to capture. Satellite data might therefore, despite the vast number of images, not be sufficient to create stereo pair images of all the refined AoIs in the mapped FUAs. Instead, false stereo pair images can be used. False stereo pair images make use of two images taken from different angles, and/or not on the same date or in a simultaneous capture. The images that form the false stereo pair should however be taken as close as possible to each other in time to improve the correlation between them, which increases precision. This approach guarantees coverage of all the refined AoIs with images from different dates. To create false stereo pairs the VHR satellite images from MAXAR products are supported with Copernicus satellite images through Copernicus Reference Access Data (CORDA), and as a further option LiDAR information.\nIn cases where no satellite image close to year 2012 is available, and also no images from CORDA, the search date range is expanded, primarily around 2012 (Q4 for 2011 or Q1 for 2013) and secondarily for later years (2014 onwards) as later years have more available satellites (WV3 etc.) from which data imagery can be gathered.\nThe process of selecting suitable VHR, CORDA and LiDAR imagery was based on the following key factors:\n\nImagery availability from the MAXAR Catalogue, CORDA\nDate of capture, see detailed description in chapter 6.2.1\nOff-Nadir Angle and Cloud Cover, see detailed description in chapter 6.2.2\n\n\n6.2.1 Date of capture\nThe following are the relevant scenarios for fulfilling the “Date of capture”-criteria for the selection of VHR and LiDAR images:\n\nScenario 1: The best option for selection of images is the use of LiDAR information from dates as close as possible to 2012, when available. This scenario shows better results since there is more density and precision.\nScenario 2: The second best option is images from 2012 taken in the same month and in the same day. Part of the area has been reviewed and is covered with images from 2012. Where images are not available, LiDAR information from 2012, or on a date as close as possible to 2012, will be prioritized for generating the BBHM.\nScenario 3: The third best option is to use images from 2012 captured in the same month but on different days.\nScenario 4: The fourth best option is using images from second half of 2011 or first half of 2013 in the same month and in the same day.\nScenario 5: The fifth best option is images from 2012 with a difference in date of capture of approximately 1 month.\nScenario 6: Scenario 2 but in the first part of 2011 or in the second part of 2013\nScenario 7 (extra): Images from 2014, 2015 and 2016… until today of similar dates (i.e. captured on the same day or week). It has been shown that images of the same season and similar date give good results for obtaining elevation models even though the dates differ by one year. The only thing that would affect this scenario is in terms of large changes in apples that were not in one of the years being analyzed. In this scenario, an analysis of change between the two dates will be made. Thanks to the refinement of the AoI the commission and omission error will be minimized because the Refined AoI is focused on the Urban Areas.\n\nThe images are selected and downloaded from the MAXAR library and organized in pairs of images for each city. The images are separated by CAT IDs, which is a unique code for each image. Images were then quality controlled for errors, reviewed and validated for use, as well as merged to ease the further processing of the images. This phase generates as a result a list of selected images to be used in the next analysis, where the algorithms for creating the DSM and DTM are applied.\n\n\n6.2.2 Off-Nadir Angle and Cloud Cover\nThe most suitable satellite images were selected, in the case of Off-Nadir angle, based on base-to-height ratio, Convergence, BIE and Asymmetry Angle. If these values, when estimated, are not in the correct range, the DSMs are not correctly built.\n\n6.2.2.1 Off-Nadir Angle\nThe best is to have images with an Off-Nadir angle of 20 degrees. Pairs formed with images that have less than 5 degrees or more than 45 degrees Off-Nadir angle give bad results, and are discarded. As far as possible, images with Off-Nadir angles of more than 40 degrees have been avoided. From these criteria two scenarios are made:\n\nScenario 1: Pair of satellite images with Off-Nadir angles of between 10 and 20 degrees\nScenario 2: Satellite images with Off-Nadir angles of between 5 and 30 degrees, preferably between 5 and 20 degrees\n\nFor urban areas, large angles of convergence would lead to ground occlusions, as well as a loss of similarity between the two images that form the “stereo pair” and, consequently, a worsening of the process of searching for homologous points by automatic correlation (matching). For these reasons, small Base/Height (B/H) ratios are preferred in urban areas (Eckert and Hollands, 2010). Using an algorithm that considers the maximum and minimum incidence angle, the time difference of the images, the angle between the two images and the region of interest, a Pearson’s correlation matrix and a B/H coefficient as a function of the orbital geometric parameters of the image, as well as temporal parameters are obtained, thanks to which it is possible to find which “false stereo pair” image is the most suitable to use in the generation of the DSM, see chapter 6.3.\n\nThe selected false stereo pair images have an angle difference of 20 degrees and none of them beyond 35 degrees.\n\n\n6.2.2.2 Cloud cover\nThe aim is to generate cloud-free results, for this reason all scenes were selected, regardless of cloud cover. This approach maximized the results, facilitating the selection of the best scenarios. In case some scattered cloudiness was found in an image, a proprietary cloud masking algorithm based on multilayer neural networks was applied. If clouds covered buildings in an image, this image was discarded. In case some scattered cloudiness could be found, a proprietary cloud masking algorithm based on multilayer neural networks was applied."

    "text": "6.3 Generating the DSM\nBased on the (false) stereo pair images, a digital surface model (DSM) is generated, which represents the height of all objects above the earth’s surface, i.e. plant/forest canopy or the top of artificial constructions such as buildings.\nThe major steps in creating the DSM are:\n\nSelection of suitable (false) stereo pair images\nPixel-wise stereo correspondence\nVoid filling\nAutomated outlier detection and removal\n3D point cloud creation, including RPC improvement\nProjection, alignment and homogenisation of the 3D point cloud\nProcess QA\n\nThe avaiable false stereo pair images for a certain AoI, obtained through the process described in chapter 6.2, are further processed to generate the DSM. The method for generating the DSM is based on taking elevations from the terrain using the false stereo pair satellite images, and by choosing the most suitable false stereo pair images. The images chosen are panchromatic with high spatial resolution of 30, 40 or 50 cm, and RPC information.\nThereafter a stereo correspondence between the two chosen images that make up each false stereo image pair is conducted, using a patented-modified version of the Semi-Global Matching (SGM) algorithm. The algorithm is based on global energy minimization that comprises a cost of equalization in pixels and smoothness terms in disparity mapping. The algorithm then applies a 3-kernel median filter to fill in small holes in null match points in the disparity map. By implementing a version of the classic RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) based on reverse methodology, outliers are eliminated.\nLastly, a 3D point cloud is obtained by triangulating the stereo correspondences between the two panchromatic VHR images, taking into consideration the rational polynomial coefficients (RPC) camera model provided for each image. The RCPs will allow triangulating the position of a 3D point identified on an image pair. This elaboration of the Digital Surface Models (DSM) is carried out using an AI-EOSURFACE algorithm on Python and C++ (and compatible with C heads) based on the epipolar geometry of a given pair of satellite images, see Figure 6‑9.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑9 Schematic representation of the epipolar geometry for a given pair of satellite images, on which the AI-EOSURFACE algorithm is based to obtain elevations\n\n\nThis algorithm has been developed for the DSM generation based on the bidimensional couple of points of a pair for the later three-dimensional densification. The dataset includes images from different platforms, all of them with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m. The DSM generation only requires the panchromatic band, however RGB and NIR bands were included as these are required for other processes of the BBHM creation.\nThe independently calculated 3D point cloud is then projected, aligned and homogenized, and the DSM is generated with a spatial resolution of 50 cm, and all DSMs are transformed to an orthometric height because to transform height data into meters of above sea level."

    "text": "6.4 Generating the DTM\nDigital terrain models (DTMs) represent the height of the bare earth’s surface. In this case, the DTMs are generated from the DSM. Non-ground features such as buildings, trees, bushes and vehicles have to be identified, and their height measurements removed from the data before interpolation. Once the DSM has been generated, it is filtered using a building emptying algorithm and removing objects that are not bare ground. Thereafter a pixel level prediction and clustering approach is used on a high-resolution multispectral image to detect the bare terrain.\nThe DTM is carried out using an AI-EOTERRAIN algorithm on Python to process each row of the given DSM separately in all directions in a window with a given extent, considering the minimum value of each row as the position of the ground. Therefore, if the pixel being evaluated has a large difference with the minimum value, the pixel is considered as not corresponding to ground, as well as when the slope between the evaluated pixel and the next one is positive and above a predefined threshold. If the slope is positive but less than the threshold, the evaluated pixel gets the same label as the pixel evaluated in the previous iteration. If the slope is less or equal, the distance to the nearest ground point is used to decide whether the evaluated pixel is classified as ground or not.\nThe building extraction process was successful with most buildings, however, in buildings that occupy a large area, the algorithm interprets the innermost areas of the roofs as ground values, due to the homogeneity of the slopes. To ensure that all values of the emptied DSM correspond to ground values, a second filtering is done using the buildings footprints layers, see chapter 6.1.4.\nDSM algorithm | Building footprints | DSM filtered\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑10 DSM filtering to remove large buildings and obtain the DTM\n\n\nThereafter the remaining bare ground is filtered by a cut off range for objects to remain in the DTM. This is based on the gradient difference, the size of the object to be removed and the terrain type, this can be either flat or hilly. A “bump and pit”-filter is applied to smoothe the DTM by removing small pits and bumps in the landscape; a median filter which is part of the final smoothing of the DTM; and finally the clamp filter, which stabilizes portions of the elevation model by raising and lowering pixels within a defined threshold.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑11 Left: DSM for an area in London. Right: DTM for an area in London\n\n\nThe generated file retains the same properties as the DSM in terms of extension and spatial resolution."

    "section": "6.6 Generating the BBHM",
    "text": "6.6 Generating the BBHM\nOnce the DHM of the city is available, it is necessary to extract only the height values that correspond to buildings. To do this, first all the buildings are detected from the available multispectral VHR images, using machine learning techniques. Then a building footprint extraction operation is performed, obtaining a GeoTIFF raster layer with the height values of the buildings, and with a NoData value for all those elements which are not buildings.\nTo extract the values that correspond to buildings, the vector files of the building footprints and the DHM files are required as input.\nSince the building footprints layer are in vector format with complex geometries, these are transformed into Boolean raster format, where the pixels with zero values represent the areas that do not include buildings.\nOnce the DHM file and its associated building footprints file are both available in raster format and with the same extension, a multiplication is performed, resulting in a DHM with height values only in the areas occupied by buildings. Finally, all pixels with zero in height value, i.e. the height assigned to all elements other than buildings, are reclassified to a NoData value, as otherwise they could have a negative influence on subsequent processes. This is an important difference to note between the 2006 and 2012 edition of the BBHM. It was introduced in this release since in the previous release it was not possible to distinguish between satellite measured zero values, and zero values assigned because of the type of area. Instead, in this release, all areas not representing buildings have a NoData value.\nFinally, the DHM has undergone resampling through a number of filters; reprojection to EPSG3035 coordinate system, removal of pixels outside of the City Perimeter AoI, removal of pixels outside of the UA Urban Areas AoI, removal of pixels within the Urban roads AoI and finally resampling from a resolution of 0.5m to a resolution of 10 m using a majority filter.\nThis point explains why it is necessary to translate the 0 height data values of the input DHM to NoData, since otherwise the majority of values in a pixel corresponding to a building could be equal to 0 due to the influence of the surrounding street.\nIt is also important to point out the role played by vegetation in this process, since, as the DSM is derived from stereoscopic images; it is possible that trees near buildings influence the final value of certain pixels.\nAlso, a reclassification of all pixels with a value lower than 3 m is performed, since it is assumed that no buildings are lower than 3 m.\nFinally, a final conversion of the DHM files is executed to adapt them to the requirements set according to CLMS Tools needs.\n\nEPSG:3035 coordinate reference system\nGeoTIFF data type UInt16.\nNo data value equal to 65535.\nCompression type LZW\nPixel size 10 m\nBLOCKSIZE 256x256 Specification\nTILED = YES\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑13 From a general DHM (left) to a BBHM (right) in Münster, Germany\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑14 Final BBHM at 10x10 meter resolution for Münster, Germany\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑15 General overview of building height values on Milano and zoom to the city center"

    "section": "6.7 Characteristics and limitations of the product",
    "text": "6.7 Characteristics and limitations of the product\nThis chapter describes the properties of the product and some methodological aspects that are important to understand the characteristics and limitations of the product.\nIt is important to note that because the DSMs are derived from LiDAR and VHR satellite information, the initially generated DHMs have a spatial resolution of between 0.5 and 2 meters. For the final product to comply with EEA technical requirements (spatial resolution of 10 meters), a resampling operation was performed to transform the DHM pixels from 0.5-2 m to 10 m.\nFor this transformation to be consistent with the first height values obtained, it was agreed to use a majority algorithm, i.e. the calculation will determine the most common value shown by the 0.5 - 2 m pixels contained within a new 10 m pixel, which will be assigned the most repeated value after the execution of this analysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑16 Methodological explanation about how the majority filter works when resampling\n\n\nIt is this simple resampling operation that poses the main limitations of the BBHM Urban Atlas product, which are further detailed below.\n\nNo height values in buildings that are smaller that the minimum mapping size\n\nDue to the spatial resolution of the pixel, there will be a NoData value in buildings smaller than 100 m2, such as single-family houses, buildings for public use etc., see example in Figure 6‑17.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑17 Small houses that have not been captured in the BBHM due to the minimum mapping size\n\n\n\nIssues on building edges\n\nThe influence of height values of elements or artifacts adjacent to the buildings can induce abnormally high or low values in the pixels of the edges of the buildings. In case of influence of the ground abnormally low values would be presented, or abnormally high values if it is a tree or other vertical element that interferes.\nThis happens, in addition to the majority algorithm, when extracting the height values within the building footprints. This is because it is very unusual that the outline of the building represented in the DHM coincides exactly with its building footprint, which causes the edge pixels to be retained in the DHM prior to the resampling process and, therefore, may interfere with the final result.\nThe example in Figure 6‑18 shows the height values obtained for a random building, in this case obtained by means of LIDAR technology, with a spatial resolution of 2 m.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑18 Satellite imagery (left) and DSM at half meter resolution (right)\n\n\nFigure 6‑19 shows how some pixels, with ground elevation information, are represented in red tones after extraction of the DHM values in relation to the building footprints.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑19 Difference between DSM at half meter resolution and final BBHM (right)\n\n\nWhen the resampling operation is performed and the final result is obtained, this ground elevation information is transferred to the pixels that make up the building boundary, causing the aforementioned alterations in the value of these pixels.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑20 Overview of building edges in the BBHM\n\n\nWithout a detailed case-by-case study it is not possible to conclude wheter these height deviations are caused by elements of the building itself or by influences from the ground or other artifacts. Thus, these pixels have not been corrected beyond those clearly identified during QC, which is the main limitation of the project.\nThe influence of edge elements becomes more noticeable in cities whose DHM values have been calculated from a DSM derived from VHR satellite imagery. This is because optical satellite photogrammetry technology does not reach the same levels of accuracy as achieved by LIDAR, and its results depend heavily on the acquisition properties of the images. Especially important are the angles and the correlation calculated between the two images, giving the results a more continuous and smooth appearance, i.e. there is no perfect detection of abrupt elevation changes intrinsic to the height difference between a building and the ground.\nThis behavior is especially noticeable in cities with a high density of buildings, close together, separated by narrow streets, typical in urban centers of historic cities. This combined with the resampling algorithm can result in areas with apparently great variability of building heights. This phenomenon can be observed in Figure 6‑21.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑21 Higher heterogeneity in BBHM dataset (right) than in a half meter resolution BBHM (bottom left)\n\n\n\nRoof artifacts\n\nAnother limitation of the product lies in the poor response to the LIDAR pulses of some roofs, especially noticeable in the metal cladding that covers some industrial buildings. These errors do not occur when using satellite photogrammetry and thus do not pose an issue in most of the processed cities. To correct the errors, the erroneous pixels are manually reclassified with the correct elevation value.\n\nLimitation of building footprints detection in scattered areas\n\nThe building footprints identification algorithm based on Machine Learning techniques has certain limitations when detecting isolated buildings, especially in rural environments, since the algorithm considers certain properties of coherence and spatial context for the identification of buildings. In the same way, the algorithm may present commission errors, which have been eliminated whenever they have been detected during QC.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑22 Limitations on building footprint detection especially; comission and omission\n\n\n\nUrban Areas with no values outside the AoI\n\nAs stated previously in the document, building height values are only gathered inside the AoI (see definition in chapter 6.1). In some cases, it is not possible to produce building height data for the entire delineation of the AoI, i.e. when part of the defined high-density cluster delineation falls outside the area that has been mapped by Urban Atlas. For example, the AoI for Malinas is a high-density cluster but is not mapped by Urban Atlas and does not have a FUA (no Urban Classes). Thus, it is key to consider that in these cases some urban areas in the city surroundings are not captured, so there is no height value.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑23 General view of Malinas, capturing industrial areas with no height values outside the AoI\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of DSM generation\n\nDSM generation from false pair stereo of satellite images is always challenging, since it depends on several variables: off-nadir angle, difference in days between images, cloud cover, etc. These values vary from city to city, but in general terms these have been the main issues:\n\nDSM orthorectification\nBuilding shadows\nSmall houses’ height\nOutlier removal\nWater-topography influence\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑24 Examples of the limitations of the DSM production\n\n\n\nLimitations on DTM generation\n\nWhen generating a DTM from DSM, the reliability on the accuracy of the DSM falls, e.g. a DSM derived from a high-density point cloud by using LiDAR information is more reliable than one built from satellite imagery. Also, an automatic algorithm pursues a constant accuracy across different realities, setting parameters to fix values that better capture all. However, larger buildings (e.g. industrial buildings) may not be removed completely, so a manual editing has been carried out in all the cities.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑25 Example of DTM refinement"
