# Introduction

This document provides a comprehensive **Land Cover/Land Use (LC/LU) nomenclature guideline**, for the Copernicus Priority Area Monitoring product **Riparian Zones** (RZ). It covers the detailed description of all LC/LU classes, their geographic characteristics, available input datasets and relevant methods to interpret the respective classes.

# LC/LU Product Description

The Riparian LC/LU product offers a detailed LC/LU dataset for areas along a buffer zone of selected rivers covering EEA-38 + UK. This product provides a consistent and very-high resolution delineation and characterisation of the Riparian Zones of major and medium-sized rivers for most of Europe and Turkey (i.e. the 38 EEA member and cooperating countries + UK), based on optical 2.5m spatial resolution satellite imagery from the ESA Data Warehouse.

The initial riparian zones map of the Copernicus Local Component (now called Priority Area Monitoring component) was available for more than 550,000 km² of EEA-39 territory and covered modelled buffer areas around selected medium and large size Strahler level 3--8 rivers. The mapping was done for the reference year 2012 with a temporal coverage of input data between 2010 and 2013. The production for Strahler levels 3-8 was finalized in 2015. In 2017/2018 a geographic extension covering buffered Strahler level 2 rivers was performed, extending the total area to 807.177 km².

In 2017 and again in 2020, the nomenclature was revised with the aim to harmonize the products of the local components (mainly Riparian Zones and NATURA 2000 products) while maintaining user requirements for both products. The revision and update of the new RZ nomenclature led to a simplification of some classes, decreasing the CODE level 4 in a coherent and non-redundant way (previous nomenclature: 79 classes / new nomenclature: 55 classes).

The mapping of land cover and land use along a buffer zone of selected areas has as main objective to support the Mapping and Assessment of Ecosystems and their Services (MAES)[^1], as part of the EU Biodiversity Strategy to 203

# Riparian LC/LU Legend

The Nomenclature for the LC/LU dataset is structured into four levels (CODE level 1 to CODE level 4). The LC/LU code levels were designed to correspond to the MAES[^2] typology of ecosystems.

# Mapping Rules

**Object Delineation:**

Object delineation is performed on VHR EO data as primary data source. In areas, where two or more satellite scenes overlap, the most recent scene is chosen as primary data source. In this regard a detailed prioritization system has been established considering especially acquisition year and acquisition month. In cases where clouds or cloud shadows cover the area of interest alternative image data can be used.

**Delineation Rules:**

Object delineation should be as follows:

- Delineation shall be angular and not round.

- Avoid digitizing too many vertices: Use vertices as few as possible and only as many as necessary to define the shape of an object.

- Avoid to map sharp angles.

- Use road centers (roads \< 10m width) as border between two objects if roads separate two features. E.g. a forest and an agricultural area are separated by a road feature \< 10m width. Map the border between forest and agriculture in the middle of the road.

**Minimum Mapping Unit (MMU)/ Minimum Mapping Width (MMW):**

The minimum mapping unit defined is ≥ 0.5 ha for all objects. A minimum width of ≥ 10m is required for all linear features.

[MMU Exceptions:]{.underline}

- Objects located at the border of the riparian zone: If an object is cut but the riparian border and the portion lying inside the RZ therefore is \< 0.5 ha, this feature is mapped, if the whole object (inside and outside the RZ) amounts to ≥ 0.5 ha. However, the MMU of those divided features lying inside the RZ must have a MMU of at least ≥ 0.2 ha. Smaller objects will be generalized.

- Linear features (roads, railways, rivers) that are split in two or more polygons by other linear elements (e.g. the road/railway network) will be mapped even if the resulting segments are smaller than the MMU in order to preserve the. However, features \< 0.1 ha will be generalized.\
  Objects inside Urban Atlas Core Regions keep their MMU of 0.25 ha and will not be generalized.

- Urban objects which are confined by roads, railways, or rivers. Features \< 0.25 ha will be generalized.

[MMW Exceptions:]{.underline}

- To maintain continuity of linear features (Codes 1.2.1.0, 1.2.2.0, 6.2.1.0, 6.2.2.0, 8.1.1.0 and 8.1.2.0); the MMW may fall below the limit of 10 m, over a distance of up to 100 m.

**Good Practice for Data Display -- Mapping Scale:**

On-screen mapping scale is 1:5.000 -- 1:10.000 depending on the landscape and feature class. Large homogeneous objects like agricultural areas or woodland are mapped at scales 1:8.000 -- 1:10.000. For all other features, 1:5.000 mapping scale is applied.

**Overlap Rules:**

Objects may not overlap. In case of real objects overlay, the following rules apply:

- If objects overlap on **different levels**, the top level is mapped.\
  Example: if an artificial canal overlaps a river, the canal is mapped continuously.

- If objects overlap on **the same level**, the visually dominant object is mapped continuously. However, if roads and railways meet on the same level, railways are mapped continuously to maintain the railway network.

**Priority Rules:**

The priority rules applied are defined as follows:

- Objects \< 0.5 ha are added to the neighboring object with the next lesser number of the same sub-class.

- Objects \< 0.5 ha are added to the neighboring object of the same upper class.

- Objects \< 0.5 ha are added to the neighboring object with the longest common border line.\
  Exception: Objects surrounded by railways or roads.\
  If an object is below the MMU size and completely surrounded by a road or railway network, it shall be aggregated with that surrounding traffic line. However, an exception is made for urban objects. Please see respective definition with Class 1.x.x.x.

**Application of Additional Data Sources:**

For data interpretation, additional data sources like CORINE Land Cover (CLC) 2012/2018, Urban Atlas (UA) 2012/2018, topographic maps, national WMS services, COTS navigation data and auxiliary data including local expertise is used.

- UA2012/2018: UA data are integrated in the RZ data set, where UA Core regions are located inside the RZ. In that case, MMU of all UA objects is kept; however class codes are recoded (as far as possible).

  Outside UA Core regions, UA data are used as important data source for class delineation and class interpretation. Thus, interpreting the same areas twice is avoided and data compatibility between UA and RZ is guaranteed.

- HRL Imperviousness Degree:

  HR Impervious Degree Layer is used to support impervious degree derivation of urban classes. IM.D. is determined by either visual interpretation based on EO data and Impervious Degree Layer or derived by an automatic routine based on IM.D. Layer and road segments.

- HRL Tree Cover Density:

  HR Forest Layer is applied to support Tree Cover Density classification. The classification is performed by either visual interpretation based on EO data and HR Forest Layer or derived by an automatic routine based on HR Forest Layer and forest segments.

- CLC2012/2018:

  CLC2012/2018 is used as important data source for class assignment. CLC data use ensures data compatibility between CLC and RZ.

- Landsat-8/5 data sets:

  For critical classes, Landsat-8/5 data are used as additional data source. They are primarily used to support cropland/grassland differentiations and to detect irrigated areas, as in those cases, mono-temporal data analysis will not provide reliable results. Landsat-8/5 time series of summer images are collected for irrigated areas and images acquired in late summer/autumn/spring are used for grassland identification.

- In-situ data:

  Diverse national in-situ data like WMS services, specific maps or classifications as well as descriptions and maps of N2000 or RAMSAR site are used to support the object interpretation.

**Standard Comments:**

In order to clarify certain mapping delineations, there are some comments defined as product attributes.

The following chapters describe the nature of all RZ LC/LU mapping classes in detail.

## 1 Urban {.unnumbered}                                    

![](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/Urban.png){width=30%}

The urban classes contain land that is covered by building structures and transport network. Urban fabrics appear in blue and darkish blue-grey on satellite images.

The establishment of the boundary between continuous, dense and low density urban fabric can be difficult to delimit. The main aspects to determine these classes are either by the presence and quantity of vegetation, or by the use of the IM.D HRL.

From the UA Mapping Guide:

- Surfaces with dominant human influence but without agricultural land use. These areas include all artificial structures and their associated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces.

- Artificial structures are defined as buildings, roads, all constructions of infrastructure and other artificially sealed or paved areas.

- Associated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces are areas functionally related to human activities, except agriculture.

- Also, the areas where the natural surface is replaced by extraction and/or deposition or designed landscapes (such as urban parks or leisure parks) are mapped in this class.

- The land use is dominated by permanent population.

Specific generalization/delineation rules are applied for urban classes:

- Segments of roads, rivers and railways \< 0.5 ha, that are necessary to represent the "network" of each feature will be mapped. Features \< 0.1 ha will be generalized.

- Urban objects confined by roads or railways ≥ 0.25 up to \< 0.5ha. Smaller urban objects will be generalized.

- If an infrastructure line is crossing a river, the bridge has to be mapped if the bridge is wider than 10 meters.

- Specific generalization rules are applied to *1.1.1.3 Low density fabric (IM.D \<30%)* class (see description of the specific class).

This category includes:

- **1.1 Urban fabric, industrial, commercial, public, military and private units**

Urban fabric contains land covered by artificial structures and transport networks. Industrial or commercial units are almost completely covered by artificial surface.

  - 1.1.1 Urban fabric (predominantly public and private units)
  
    - 1.1.1.1 Continuous Urban fabric (IM.D ≥80%)
  
    - 1.1.1.2 Dense urban fabric (IM.D ≥30-80%)
  
    - 1.1.1.3 Low density urban fabric (IM.D \<30%)
  
  - 1.1.2 Industrial, commercial and military units
  
    - 1.1.2.0 Industrial, commercial and military units

- **1.2 Transport infrastructure**

Motorways, roads and railways with its associated land and installations are included in this class if width \>10 m. Airports and port areas with installations and associated land are included. If an infrastructure line is crossing a river, the bridge has to be mapped if the bridge is wider than 10 m.

  - 1.2.1 Road networks and associated land

    - 1.2.1.0 Road networks and associated land

  - 1.2.2 Railways and associated land

    - 1.2.2.0 Railways and associated land

    - 1.2.3.0 Port areas and associated land

  - 1.2.4 Airports and associated land

    - 1.2.4.0 Airports and associated land

- **1.3 Mineral extraction, dump and construction sites, land without current use**

Dump sites include public, industrial or mine dump sites. Construction development, soil and bedrock excavations and earthwork are included in this class. Land without current use is land that is in transitional phase and it is included in urban areas.

  - 1.3.1 Mineral extraction, dump and construction sites

    - 1.3.1.0 Mineral extraction, dump and construction sites

  - 1.3.2 Land without current use

    - 1.3.2.0 Land without current use

- **1.4 Green urban, sports and leisure facilities**

Green urban areas are areas with vegetation within the urban fabric and it includes parks. Sports and leisure facilities are included (camping grounds, sport grounds, leisure parks, golf courses, race courses, etc.). It also comprises parks not surrounded by urban areas.

  - 1.4.0 Green urban, sports and leisure facilities

    - 1.4.0.0 Green urban, sports and leisure facilities

**Appearance:**

Urban fabric appears in blue or dark blue /grey colours on satellite images.

Distinguishing between different levels of urban fabric has to be done with help of IM.D HRL.

**MMU Exceptions:**

- Exceptions from MMU \>0.5 ha are made for "*1.2.1.0 road network*" and "*1.2.2.0 railway*" in order to keep the network formed by these linear features (always with 0.1 ha \< MMU \< 0.5 ha).

- Further exception is all urban elements being confined by rails, roads or rivers. In those cases urban features up to a MMU of 0.25 ha are kept and flagged with comments ("Area size exception").

**MMW Exceptions:**

- To maintain continuity of linear features (1.2.1.0 / 1.2.2.0 / 6.2.1.0 / 6.2.2.0 / 9.1.1.0 / 9.1.2.0), the MMW may fall below the limit of 10 m over a distance of up to 100 m.

**Methodological Advice:**

- If local in-situ data other than UA available, use if suitable.

- IM.D HRL has to be used outside UA Core, for delineation support. .

- For interpretation of urban density: Use IM.D HRL.

[Generalisation Rules:]{.underline}

If a strict MMU \>0.5 ha mapping of class *1.1.1.3* is applied, the low urban density areas would be underestimated. Therefore, to get a good representation of the area, the following generalisation rules will be adopted:

- Do not apply the 10 m MMW distance rule at the urban fringe but apply a \< 50m MMW to generalize outline.

- Include private gardens.

- Avoid mapping of single urban segments.

- Map the "whole structure".

- Close gaps at the urban fringe applying a maximum width of 50 m.

In any case, real agricultural/grassland parcel contained within urban surroundings, will be mapped as agricultural/grassland.

[Use of Auxiliary Data:]{.underline}

If UA is available, keep the outline and just correct real errors. "Fine-tuning" of the class borders is not necessary.

**1.1.2.0 Industrial, Commercial and Military Units**

**Definition:**

This category contains industrial, commercial and military units. The administrative border and associated areas, such as roads, sealed areas and vegetated areas are included, if these areas are below the MMU. It also contains public, military and private services.

At least 30% of the ground is covered by artificial surfaces. More than 50% of those artificial surfaces are occupied by buildings and/or artificial structures with non-residential use, i.e. industrial, commercial or carriage related uses are dominant.

The texture is homogenous with large buildings, car parks and sheds representing industrial or commercial complexes. Industrial or commercial units located in urban fabric are only taken into account if they are clearly distinguishable from residential areas.

**Methodological Advice:**

- If local in-situ data other than UA available, use if suitable.

- Use COTS transport infrastructure data.

- Roads will be used from COTS navigation systems, where available. In case of geometrical differences between EO data and COTS navigation data, the COTS navigation data has to be corrected in line with the EO data.

- Roads do not necessarily have to form a closed network. Isolated traffic lines are possible, but they have to be mapped with regard to the MMU criterion.

- Associated land \< 0.5 ha MMU is mapped with the roads as it is visible in the EO data and topographic maps.

- If a road is covered by a tunnel, the LU/LC over the tunnel has to be mapped.

**Methodological Advice:**

- If local in-situ data other than UA available, use if suitable.

- Use COTS transport infrastructure data, if available.

- Railways do not necessarily have to form a closed network. Isolated railway lines are possible, but they have to be mapped with regard to the MMU criterion.

- Associated land \< 0.5 ha is mapped with the railways as it is visible in the EO data and topographic maps, also in industrial sites.

- Railways always form the top-level. They clip all other features. If a road bridge spans above a railway line (different topological levels), the road is mapped.

- Minimum mapping width \>=10m.

- If a railway is covered by a tunnel, the LU/LC over the tunnel has to be mapped.

[Generalisation Rules:]{.underline}

Secondary railway lines within urban context have to be mapped if they are visible in the images or if they can be supported by ancillary data.

In industrial sites, rail networks are often complicated and hard to delineate in SPOT5/6 if no ancillary data are available. If no auxiliary data are available, map only those railroad features that can be detected with SPOT5/6 data.

## 2 Cropland {.unnumbered}

![](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image70.png){width=30%}

Cropland is the main food production area. It includes both, intensively managed ecosystems and multifunctional areas supporting many semi-natural and natural species along with food production (lower intensity management). It comprises regularly or recently cultivated agricultural, horticultural and domestic habitats and agro-ecosystems with significant coverage of natural vegetation (agricultural mosaics) (Maes et. al., 2013).

MAES categorizes croplands in three main groups:

- Arable Land

- Permanent Crops

- Heterogeneous agricultural areas

**Arable Land** is land under a rotation system used for annually harvested plants and fallow lands. The land is permanently or not irrigated. It includes cereals, oil seed plants, vegetables, beets, fodder and flooded crops such as rice and other inundated croplands.

**Permanent crops** are surfaces that are not under a rotation system but last for many seasons and need not to be replanted after harvest. Included are ligneous crops of standard cultures for fruit production such as extensive fruit orchards, olive groves, chestnut groves, walnut groves, shrub orchards such as vineyards and some specific low-system orchard plantation, espaliers and climbers. In the case of irrigated permanent crops, the qualification of irrigation prevails over permanent, thus, all the irrigated permanent crops are classified as *2.1.1.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land*.

**Heterogeneous agricultural areas** comprise surfaces where several categories are mixed. This may be either annual crops associated with permanent crops on the same parcel or annual crops cultivated under forest trees. Moreover, also combinations of annual crops, meadows and/or permanent crops mixed with natural vegetation or natural areas belong to this class.

Specific decision rules have been stabilised to distinct different types of heterogeneous agricultural areas:

- Annual crops associated or in mosaic with permanent crops (vineyards, olives groves and non-irrigated fruits trees) in parcels \< 0.5 has. →*2.3.1.0 Annual crops associated with permanent crops*.

- Mosaic or association of arable land and permanent crops in parcels \< 0.5 has. →*2.3.2.0 Complex cultivation patterns*.

- Mix of arable land and pastures → *2.3.2.0 Complex cultivation patterns.*

- Crops (annual/permanent/irrigated/non-irrigated) and mosaic of crops and pastures in mosaic or invaded by natural vegetation (agricultural area \> 75% and presence of parcels) → *2.3.3.0 Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation.*

- Agro-forestry landscapes in specific locations → *2.3.4.0 Agro-forestry*.

This category includes:

- **2.1 Arable land**

  - 2.1.1 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land

    - 2.1.1.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land

  - 2.1.2 Greenhouses

**Methodological Advice:**

- Computer assisted visual interpretation of DWH CORE_03 data.

- Use of additional data sources like e.g. AWiFS imagery of DWH CORE_08, Core_01 EO data, Landsat Archive, HRL Grassland layer or any other additional data source available on national/local level for effective differentiation between arable land and grassland.

- EO data acquired outside the vegetation period may also support the discrimination between arable land and grassland.

- Ancillary data in specific cases (LPIS - Land Parcel Identification System -Swedish Board of Agriculture-/ Topographic map --Lantmäteriet- in the case of Sweden).

- **Class 2.1.1.0 Type B: Irrigated Arable Land and Rice Fields**

**Definition:**    

Crops irrigated permanently or periodically. Most of the crops cannot be cultivated without an artificial water supply.                                                                   
Use of permanent irrigation infrastructure (irrigation channels, drainage network, irrigation ponds). This class includes also rice fields and irrigated fruits trees and vineyards in Mediterranean region. Irrigated arable land is restricted to Mediterranean areas, except clear areas with irrigated permanent infrastructures in other regions (such as Po river valley or Danube plain in Romania). The delimitation of Mediterranean will be based on biogeographic regions cartography.                    

***This type includes:*** 

- **Traditional irrigated arable land with permanent irrigation infrastructure**. Traditional irrigation areas located in fertile alluvial soils alongside the main Mediterranean rivers. These areas also include intensively or extensively managed fruit trees.

The location of the center-pivot systems can vary from an agricultural year to another within the same area.

- **Fruit trees irrigated permanently and intensively managed**. Full irrigation is needed to maintain these crops (e.g. orange trees, lemon trees, peach trees, etc.). Irrigated strawberries fields intensively managed. Intensively irrigated vineyards in Mediterranean region. In many cases associated to artificial irrigations ponds. Well represented in Southern Spain. Parcel with young tree plantations are also included (identifiable by soil removal, big parcels, presence of irrigation ponds, etc.).

  - Center-pivot irrigation parcels within these traditional irrigated areas are included in *2.1.1.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land.*
  
![Example of final result of classification of traditional irrigated land with traditional infrastructures](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image94.png){fig-align="left"}

- **Irrigated land using underground water:**

  - Extraction or irrigated land based on spectral signature of summer-time imagery of use of series of images (as Landsat). 
  
  - Parcels with the accurate spectral signature and \> 0.5 ha will be considered as *2.1.1.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land*.
  
  - Only it will be considered parcels irrigated at the date of the image. If summer-time imagery are not available Landsat time series will be used.

[Distinction Irrigated/Non-Irrigated Land in Mediterranean Region:]{.underline}

In order to extract irrigated areas in Mediterranean region, the use of time series images is essential: irrigated areas are characterized by red colours in infrared combinations bands in summer time, meanwhile, at the same time, non-irrigated parcels have not vegetation.

![Harran (Turkey) SPOT-5 (2.5 m.) (NIR/R/G Band Combination). Date: 2011-06-04 and 2011-07-15 .Source: CNES 2011© Distribution Airbus DS/Spot Image.](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image100.png){fig-align="left"}

- There are discrepancies between coverages on the overlapped area. It is not possible to produce a proper LC/LU interpretation for irrigated land using only mono-temporal CORE03 images. In this case is only possible to detect irrigated parcels (in red colours) using the most suitable image (in this case the image dated 2011-07-15).

- When using only one acquisition date image, irrigated areas can be often dismissed. Further assessment and revision will be required.

- CORE03 and Landsat series will be used.

- The reference year for the time series selection must be the most frequent year on the CORE03 product.

- Both irrigated and non-irrigated area delimitation should be performed through CORE03 product, while time series Landsat images must be considered to assign the appropriate category (*2.1.1.0*).

**2.3.2.0 Complex Cultivation Patterns**

**Definition:**

Mosaic of small parcels of diverse annual crops, pastures and/or permanent crops. Small irrigated parcels mixed with non-irrigated arable land (includes irrigated fruit trees).

This class includes mixed parcels (\< 0.5 ha) of permanent crops (fruits trees as almonds and others, berry plantations, vineyards and olive groves.

The distinction from *2.3.3.0* *Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation* is that in class *2.3.2.0, the* natural vegetation (patches of trees, small forests, and scrub) or natural objects like little lakes or ponds, need to be present. This is not the case for class *2.3.2.0 Complex Cultivation Patterns.* Here we only have a mixture of annual crops, grassland and/or permanent crops, but no natural vegetation.

For the distinction of complex cultivation patterns in class *2.1.1.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land* regarding irrigation, is that in the complex pattern in class 2.1.1.0 there are irrigated parcels (annual and permanents crops), but given the size of the parcels (\<0.5 ha), it is not possible to distinguish between *2.1.1.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land*.

**2.3.4.0 Agro-Forestry**

**Definition:**

Agro-forestry is a land use management system in which trees or shrubs are grown around or among crops or pastures. It combines agricultural and forestry techniques to achieve a more sustainable land use system. An example of this landscape is the *dehesa* (located in southern and central Spain and southern Portugal where it is called *montado*).

This category is limited to the **Mediterranean area**.

In this landscape the understory is regularly cleared of scrubs to improve grasslands or trees. 

In agroforestry areas with T.C.D. \< 30% it is frequent the presence of arable land.

Agro-forestry areas with more than 50% of scrub understory are considered as forest. 

Agro-forestry areas (grassland understory) with less than 10% T.C.D. are considered as grassland.

## 3 Woodland and Forest {.unnumbered}

![](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image147.png){fig-align="left"}

The woodland and forest classes are mainly dominated by woody vegetation of various ages or by succession of climax vegetation types (MAES et al. 2013). The interpretation is done according to FAO (2000) with tree cover \>10%, MMU of 0.5 ha and trees able to reach 5 m height in-situ at maturity. Young natural stands and all plantations established for forestry purposes, which have yet to reach a crown density of 10% or tree height of 5 m, are also included as forest. These areas normally are part of the forest area although temporarily unstocked because of human intervention or natural reasons but which are expected to revert to forest.

Forest further comprises:

- nurseries and seed orchards that constitute an integral part of the forest;

- forest roads;

- cleared tracts \< 0.5 ha;

- firebreaks and other small open areas \< 0.5 ha;

- forest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas with an area of more than 0.5 ha and width of more than 10 m (which goes beyond the FAO Forest definition of 20 m);

- plantations primarily used for forestry purposes, including rubber wood plantations and cork oak stands.

Land predominantly used for agricultural practices is excluded. Excluded is also land with:

- either a crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of 5-10% of trees able to reach a height of 5m at maturity in situ;

- a crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than 10% of trees not able to reach a height of 5m at maturity in situ (e.g. dwarf or stunted trees);

- shrub or bush cover of more than 10 percent is not accounted as Forest.

The differentiation between broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest is in accordance with CLC interpretation guideline and HR Forest definition.

**Broadleaved forest:** Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where broadleaved species predominate and represent more than 75% of the pattern.

**Coniferous forest:** Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where coniferous species predominate and represent more than 75% of the pattern.

**Mixed forest:** Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where neither broadleaved nor coniferous species predominate. The share of coniferous or broad-leaved species does not exceed 75% in the canopy closure.

The definition of Woodland and Forest is mainly oriented along aggregated EUNIS habitat classes.

Forest type interpretation might be problematic in locations with sunny slopes or in hilly regions with shady slopes.

Fire breaks will be classified according to their current land covers.

This type of forest comprises the tree species *Fagus* (EUNIS G1.6), deciduous or semi-deciduous thermophiles types like *Quercus* species and *Carpinus orientalis*, *Castanea sativa* or *Ostrya carpinifolia* (EUNIS G1.7). Moreover, *Quercus robur* or *Quercus petraea* on acid soils (G1.8), non-riverine/swamp forest composed of *Betula*, *Populus tremula* or *Sorbus aucuparia* (G1.9) species; *Quercus robur*, *Ulmus spp*., *Fraxinus excelsior*, *Tilia cordata* or *Acer platanoides* (G1.A) and woods dominated by *Alnus* (G1.B).

Also forest on wet ground (e.g. moors, swamps, marshes, fens or peat bogs). On non-acid peat the class is comprised of the tree species *Alnus*, *Populus*, *Quercus* swamp woods (EUNIS G1.4). On wet acid peat *Betula pubescens* or rarely *Alnus glutinosa* (EUNIS G1.5) are predominate.

In addition, this class comprises broadleaved sclerophyllous or lauriphyllous evergreen trees and palms, which are characteristic for the Mediterranean and warm-temperate humid zones (EUNIS class G2). In these regions broadleaved evergreen forest is predominate and represents more than 75% of the pattern.

**3.6.0.0 Damaged Forest**

**Definition:**

Damaged forest includes areas still visible in the satellite image e.g. spectrally due to discoloration of needles and leaves or trees lying on the ground. Either pests, storm or tornado events or snow and ice damage may have caused the forest damage.

In most cases, the damage affects monocultures, as these are more vulnerable than mixed forests. Severe bark-beetle attacks, however, are most evident in National Parks, as the park regulations do not allow counteractions that may confine the damage.

Forest damaged by fire will mainly occur in southern Europe where wildfires are a common phenomenon. In Central Europe forest fires are rare and occur only sometimes during very hot and dry summers on south-facing slopes.

## 4 Grassland {.unnumbered}

![](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/Grassland.png){width=30%}

The grassland classes are areas dominated by grassy vegetation of two kinds --managed pastures and (semi-) natural (extensively managed) grasslands[^3]. Generally grasses (basically *[graminacea]{.underline}* plants but can include tall forbs, rushes and sedges, mosses and lichens) covers more than 30% of the soils (EUNIS description), called below Crown Cover Density (C.C.D.).

According to Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive, European natural grasslands are limited to alpine meadows (as Alpine, Pyrenean and Oro-Iberian grasslands) and other located grasslands.

In this sense, MAES level 2 natural grasslands are considered as natural and semi-natural grasslands and managed grasslands are agricultural grasslands. The main characteristics of agricultural grassland are the high human influence, basically cultivation and visible parcel structure in EO data.

Semi-natural grasslands are frequently associated with trees and scrubs. These grasslands should be managed to maintain their grass coverage, basically by cutting out scrubs manually or mechanically. The combination of trees and grasslands is also present in many locations in Europe (in alluvial areas; in wooded hay meadows; due forest clearing, etc.). *Dehesas* and other wooded pastures, as *Fennoscandinavian wooded pastures,* are included in MAES Croplands class (agroforestry systems located in South Western Europe) or woodland and forest (in the case of forest pastures)*.*

This category includes:

- **4.1 Managed grassland**

  - 4.1.0 Managed grassland

    - 4.1.0.0 Managed grassland

- **4.2 Natural & semi natural grassland**

  - 4.2.1 Semi-natural grassland

    - 4.2.1.0 Semi-natural grassland

  - 4.2.2 Alpine and sub-alpine natural grassland

    - 4.2.2.0 Alpine and sub-alpine natural grassland
    
----

**4.1.0.0 Managed Grassland**

**Definition:** 

Managed grasslands are considered intensively managed areas for the production of grass. From a land use point of view, in the case of these agricultural grasslands, grass is a crop in the same way as cereals or others. Managed grasslands could be divided into improved and semi-improved grasslands according to their management.

Agricultural grasslands occupy huge areas in the lowlands of the European plain and in United Kingdom and Ireland, where they have a longer growing season due to climatic conditions, leaving dryer areas for arable crops. In many areas, arable land and agricultural grasslands are mixed.

This category corresponds to 231 Corine class (Pastures). According to the statistical analysis of Corine Land Cover 2006 data, pastures (231 classes) occupied 66% of more than 60.000.000 ha considered as grasslands (classes 231-pastures- and 321 --natural grasslands-). 

The main characteristics of an ideally improved agricultural grassland farmland are [^4]

- The grass farmland is dominated by selected grasses, especially perennial, and the crop is very dense. In early spring, the grassland is often fertilized by the farmer. These grass farmland areas are chlorophyll rich almost all year long and do not contain or contain very little dead biomass. 

- Intensive cutting and grazing is done during the grass growing season (usually from April to September). 

- The grass could be cut and preserved for winter feeding. The grass for silage must be harvested in an optimum moment. 

- Some farmers spread the grass by mower to achieve a better wilt, with the objective to remove excessive moisture for silage. This process could generate rows in the land due to accumulation of grasses. In many cases, this makes grasses undistinguishable from arable land using remote sensing techniques. 

- Fertilizers are applied. 

- Agricultural grassland could be reseeded. 

- Usually there are farm buildings (silages; covered yards; stables, etc.) around.

- Often/mainly used for grazing.

- Improved grassland could be included in rotation. In many countries and in European regulations (as EC Regulation 796/2004 related to EU agricultural policy) an area is considered as "permanent grassland" if the land is covered by grasses during at least five years. 

Per definition, there is no tree or scrub presence in improved grasslands

In between the intensively used grass farmland or in specific regions (as the *bocage* landscape in France), there can be plots of less intensive or extensive grassland, e.g. mowed only once a year. This type of grasslands (lowland and mountain hay meadows) could be considered as semi-improved grasslands (*prairie* in France; *prado* in Spain). Like in mountain alpine meadows, the percentage of wild floral species can increase. These grasslands can content trees and scrubs, especially trees walls around the parcels.

![Schematic representation of managed (semi-improved) grasslands](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image198.jpeg){fig-align="left"}

Managed grasslands are discriminated from arable land using Landsat and VHR images, specific color and structure patterns (arable land parcels are generally more angular in shape than pastures and the texture is smooth) and the identification of cultivation tracks, but a certain grade of confusion between two classes is expected. Arable land, in Continental; Mediterranean and Nordic environments, typically appears on flat lowland soils with clay / fine sediment and few blocks. They are therefore generally more angular in shape than pastures and the texture is smooth.

- Arable land/managed grasslands (= permanent) discrimination: use of Landsat imagery or other EO datasets acquired outside the vegetation period (August-October, March/April) and application of specific colour patterns.

![Typical arable land colour patterns in Landsat images](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image209.png){fig-align="left"}

![Typical grasslands colour patterns in Landsat images](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image224.png){fig-align="left"}

- Use of VHR images to detect cultivation tracks. In many cases, mowing management of grassland produces tracks similar to those in arable land but with different pattern and row distance.

- Use of specific in-situ data (as Land Parcel identification System in the case of Sweden).

- Grassland is often situated in specific locations, e. g. along rivers and near lakes.

- Final detailed delineation and identification using computer assisted visual interpretation. 

- Use of semi-automatic methods or visual interpretation to determine tree density.

[Special Case: Grasslands containing Trees and Scrubs]{.underline} 

- Grassland with trees (including trees in fences \< 10 meters) → *4.1.0.0 Managed grasslands.* 

- Small patches of forest inside these areas → 3. *Forests.*

- Lines of trees with more 10 meters → *3.4.2.0 Lines of trees and scrub.*

**4.2.1.0 Semi Natural Grassland**

**Definition:** 

By (semi-) natural grasslands we mean areas where the herbaceous plants are natural but are created and maintained as permanent grasslands by less intensive agricultural activities[^5]. Here are also included marginal grasslands: abandoned crop invaded by grasses; areas near roads and other infrastructures; abandoned dumping sites, etc.

Semi natural grasslands include both dry grasslands and mesic grasslands:

- *Dry Grasslands:* The EUNIS definition of dry grassland is: "*Well drained or dry lands dominated by grass or herbs, mostly not fertilized and with low productivity. Included are \[Artemisia\] steppes. Excluded are dry Mediterranean lands with shrubs of other genera where the shrub cover exceeds 10%; these are listed as garrigue* (F6)[^6]."

The Annex I of Habitat Directive considers diverse grassland types as dry grasslands, from **calcareous grasslands of central and western Europe,** to steppes in Pannonic region or pseudo-steppes in Mediterranean areas. In all cases, these are grasslands located in less fertile soils, and are extensively managed (not ploughed and rarely fertilized) and used for livestock grazing. In Annex I this type of grasslands are considered as semi-natural.

In the Mediterranean Region, dry grasslands are considered by the Annex I of Habitat Directive as **pseudo-steppes**. They are characterized by their loss of greenness in summer-time and are devoted to livestock grazing. In Hungary and other countries we find steppes grasslands (known here as *puszta*), as part of the dry grasslands. **Pannonian steppes** are flat alluvial plains dominated by herbaceous plants extensively managed and strongly transformed by agriculture. Turkey is also dominated by the **Eurasian steppe** (Central Anatolia steppe; Easter Anatolia Montane Steppe and Ponto-Sarmatic steppes in the Black Sea region). Semi-natural dry grasslands are also present in **salt steppes** and in **gypsum steppes** across Europe. Mediterranean salt steppes (Limonietalia); Iberian gypsum vegetation (Gypsophiletalia) and Pannonic salt steppes and salt marshes are also considered as semi-natural grasslands. Nordic ***alvar*** grasslands are also included here. These grasslands are located in dry calcareous and limestone bedrocks, covered by snow in winter and subject to strong winds. Regularly clearing is necessary to avoid scrubs. Coastal grasslands as ***machairs*** (specific coastal old landscape present in dunes in western Ireland and Scotland) dominated by grasses are also included. 

In the case of steppes (Anatolian steppe) and Mediterranean pseudo-steppes (dry Mediterranean grasslands), grasses and grass-like plants are mixed with patches of rocks and/or sparsely vegetated areas. These habitats (especially Anatolian steppes) are characterized by low biomass due to dry conditions and poor soils. In many cases these steppes suffer for over-grazing and erosion[^7]. As results, especially during summer time, it is not feasibly the distinction using EO data between areas covered by grasses (MAES class 4. *Grassland*) and rocks and areas with sparsely vegetation (MAES class 6. *Sparsely vegetated land*). In this case has been adopted the concept of steppes and pseudo-steppes as an edaphic climax habitat dominated by grasses and grass-like plants but with a high presence of sparsely vegetated areas. In this sense, generalization rules are applied (inclusion as grassland patches of low vegetation biomass) in order to avoid an excessive mapping fragmentation.

Dry grassland in Atlantic and Continental regions are restricted to very located sites affected by poor soils conditions such as calcareous dry grasslands in Western Germany, grasslands located in chalk cliffs in Denmark, grassland located in karstic regions in the Balkans or Nordic *alvars*[^8].

- *Mesic Grasslands:* The EUNIS definition of mesic grasslands (E2) is: "*Lowland and montane mesotrophic and eutrophic pastures and hay meadows of the boreal, nemoral, warm-temperate humid and mediterranean zones. They are generally more fertile than dry grasslands (E1), and include sports fields and agriculturally improved and reseeded pastures*". In EUNIS habitat classification[^9], the habitats are separated according the presence of water: waterlogged (the water table at or above ground level for at least half of the year), permafrost (habitats where the soil is at a temperature of less than 0^o^C throughout the year) and other (always dry; mesic, moist or humid; only seasonally wet; regularly but infrequently flooded or occasionally flooded by extreme weather conditions but which are free-draining; wet but not waterlogged; permanent snow and ice.). Here we consider mesic grasslands as mesic and moist or humid grasslands. The separation between mesic grasslands and wetlands is that the latter are waterlogged or frequently flooded.

Taken into account Annex I Habitat Directive and EUNIS classification following grasslands types are included here:

- Semi-natural humid meadows: wet pastures (including riverine meadows), Mediterranean alluvial meadows and Northern boreal alluvial meadows. 

- Mesophile grassland not included in *4.1.0.0 Managed grasslands,* including abandoned hay meadows.

**4.2.2.0 Alpine and Sub-Alpine Natural Grassland**

**Definition:** 

According EUNIS definition "*primary and secondary grass- or sedge- dominated formations of the alpine and subalpine levels of boreal, nemoral, mediterranean, warm-temperate humid and Anatolian mountains*"[^10].  

This category includes following natural grasslands identified in Annex I Habitat Directive:  

- 6140 *Siliceous Pyrenean Festuca eskia grasslands*[^11] (in the Pyrenees and Cantabrian mountains in Spain); 

- 6150 *Siliceous alpine and boreal grasslands*[^12] (acidic grasslands of mountains in the Alps, Carpathians and Scandinavia together with higher mountains elsewhere in northern Europe such as in the north of the British Isles); 

- 6160 *Oro-Iberian Festuca indigesta grasslands*[^13] (located in the high Mediterranean mountains of the Iberian Peninsula); and 

- 6170 *Alpine and subalpine calcareous grasslands* (present in the Alps, Pyrenees, Carpathian and Scandinavian mountains, highest mountains of Corsica, Apennines, Cantabrian, Betic and Iberic mountains in Spain, Dinaric Alps, the mountains of Greece and Turkey and the Scottish Highlands[^14]) 

These natural grasslands are known commonly as *alpine meadows.* In all the cases, these alpine meadows involve grasses growing above the limits of the mountain hay meadows and forests (in many cases in areas with mountain scrublands and barren rocks). 

The majority of these alpine grasslands are grazed traditionally in summer-time under traditional transhumance regimes.   

Per definition, there are no trees in alpine grasslands or their presence is rare.  

Related EUNIS Habitat Classification: E4.

***This category includes:***

- Natural grasslands (occasionally grazed) above the tree line[^15] with low fraction of bare rock or gravel, shrubs and sporadic trees. Grasslands cover at least 30% of the surface. Low managed grassland close to the tree line with high grasses density and no land plot structure present are also included here.

- In the case of Nordic countries this class includes natural grasslands and extensive/former grazed grasslands above the tree line. 

***This category excludes:***

- Mountain hay meadows (managed grasslands) below tree line → *4.1.0.0* *Managed grassland*.  

- Alpine heaths, usually located between the tree line and the grasslands formations → *5. Heathland and scrub.* 

- Surfaces covered by mosses and lichen → *6. Sparsely vegetated land*. 

- Grasslands with less than 50 % field cover (in climax stage), such as snow bed grassland → *6. Sparsely vegetated land.*

**Methodological Advice**:

- Extraction of potential subalpine (this zone also include forests) and alpine zones (above the tree line) included in LC/LU buffer area using EU-DEM according regional altitudinal zonification: 

**Mountainous Area (associated AOI)** | **Subalpine Altitudinal Zone (above m.)**
:-- | :--
Alps | 1,600 m.[^16]  
Black Forest, Harz, Vosgues | 1,200 m.[^17]  
Pyrenees | 1,600 m.[^18]  
Cantabrian Mountains and Mountains of Central Spain | 1,700 m.[^19]  
Carpathians mountains | 1,390 m.[^20]  
Tatra Mountains | 1,550 m.[^21]  
Uplands of Scotland | 900 m.[^22]  
Turkey mountains | 1,500 m.[^23]  
Corsica mountains | 1,600 m.[^24]

- Analysis of the extraction of tree line from HRL Forest. 

- Final delineation and identification using computer assisted visual interpretation. 

- In the case of Nordic countries, and considering the heterogeneous nature of this class, a polygon may include up to 30% of the classes *3.1.1.0. Natural & semi-natural broadleaved forest, 5.1.1.0. Heathland and moorland, 5.1.2.0. Other scrub land, 7.2.2.0. Unexploited peat bog, 6.1.0.0. Sparsely vegetated areas and 6.3.1.0. Bare rocks and rock debris* if these surfaces are too small to map separately. The specified class should therefore cover at least 70% of the surface. The minimum mapping unit for these heterogeneous classes will be around 1 ha. 

## 5 Heathland and Scrub {.unnumbered}

![](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/Heathland.png){width=30%}

Heathland and scrub is divided into two classes depending on whether the shrubby vegetation is evergreen and adapted to water loss (*Sclerophyllous vegetation*) or not (*Moors and heathland*).

*Moors and heathland* appears in both temperate and frigid zones. Areas with heath and dwarf scrub vegetation adheres to the class *5.1.1.0* *Heathland and moorlands*. Areas dominated by brush woods and bush-like forest adheres to the class *5.1.2.0* *Other scrub land*.

Sclerophyllous vegetation appears in Mediterranean region.

This category includes:

- **5.1 Heathland and Moorland**

  - 5.1.0. Heathland and Moorland

    - 5.1.0.0 Heathland and Moorland

- **5.2 Alpine scrubland**

***This category includes:***  

- Areas where the field layer has a cover of more than 50 % at the phenological mature stage. (The date of the satellite data is crucial, especially in the northern countries where the vegetation period is short. An area may change from 0 % to 100 % green field cover within weeks).

- Heath and scrub formation in Atlantic, sub-Atlantic and sub-Continental areas with *Ulex spp*., *Calluna vulgaris*, V*accinium spp.*, *Erica spp*, *Genista spp.*, *Vaccinium myrtillus* and *Rubus spp*.

*Matorral* in South-Western Spain. In Mediterranean areas, rain is concentrated in spring and autumn and red colors in scrubs are not rare as is the case.

**Methodological Advice:** 

- Sometimes is complicate to distinguish this class from the forested areas, as the colours in the SPOT image are quite similar (sometimes the only difference is density). Therefore, auxiliary information is necessary to support a correct interpretation and delineation.

- Use of CLC class 3.2.3 as information source.

- Use HRL Forests to detect the trees, which can be potentially, class *5.2.0.0 Sclerophyllous vegetation*.  

- Final detailed delineation and identification using computer assisted visual interpretation.

## 7 Wetland {.unnumbered}

![](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/Wetland.png){width=30%}

According to Article 1.1 of the Ramsar Convention[^25] (1971), wetlands are: "*areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters*". This MAES class refers only to inland freshwater/saline wetlands.

Inland wetlands are predominantly **water-logged** specific plant and animal communities supporting **water regulation** and **peat-related processes**. This class includes natural or modified mires, bogs and fens, as well as peat extraction sites[^26] (MAES). Surfaces of temporary water are included in wetlands. According EUNIS guidelines (see table below), water-logged means the presence of the water table at or above ground level for at least half of the year.

***Adaptation of water interpretation in EUNIS***[^27] ***and related RZ classes***

**7.1.1.0 Inland Marshes**

**Definition:** 

Inland wetlands without a direct connection to the open ocean with significant content of water, which is influenced by a certain seasonal fluctuation.

This category corresponds to 411 CORINE Land Cover class (Inland marshes). Both inland freshwater marshes and inland salt marshes are included in this class. They are created where saline ground water rises to the surface, or in endorheic basins. 

Inland marshes appear with or without a vegetation coverage. The coverage usually consists of reeds. Reed is a common name for several tall, grass-like plants of wetlands and rivers. They are all members of the order Poales: *Poaceae*, *Cyperaceae*, *Sparganiaceae*, *Typhacea* or *Restionaceae*.  

Reed in marshes groups basically two types of plants: 

- Sedges (*Cyperaceae* family) are monocotyledon plants with solid and triangular stems; 3-ranked leaves; with flowers, and lenticular or triangular fruits. Sedges are common in wet habitats, including marshes, and in tundra habitats.

- Rushes (*Juncaceae family*) are monocotyledon plants with solid and mostly round stems; few leaves, only basal or reduced to sheaths; with flowers and fruits in capsules. Rushes are common in wet habitats.  

If not covered by vegetation: basically mud areas and/or waterlogged grasses and grass-like plants will be mapped. 

Inland salt marshes without vegetation are located predominantly in Pannonic region (*Pannonic salt steppes*), Turkey, in Mediterranean specific locations and in endorheic basins across Europe.

***This category includes:***

- Marshes (freshwater or salt) with or without vegetation (reeds) coverage. 

- Areas where reeds are harvested. 

- Reed covered wetland along river sides 

- In Nordic conditions: includes non-grazed/mowed and non-peat producing wetlands. These areas normally have a vegetation of tall grasses and sedges. 

- Areas flooded at least six months a year with low or no vegetation. 

- Grasslands highly wet or flooded at least six months a year.

- Bare soils as results of previous presence of water will be also included within this category. 

- It will be taken into account that the Baltic Sea has only brackish coastal waters, which qualify for inland freshwater marshes.

- Limestone mires.

- Floating vegetation. 

- Reed beds in saline marshes with coverage less than 30%.

***This category excludes:*** 

- Floating aquatic vegetation (species such as *Nuphar* spp., *Nymphaea* spp., *Potamageton* spp. and *Lemna* spp.) is not considered as reeds and is included in *8.2.* *Lakes and reservoirs or 8.4 Sea and ocean.* 

- Grassland highly wet or flooded less than six months a year → *4.1.0.0 / 4.2.1.x Managed or semi natural grassland*. 

- Rice fields → *2.1.1.0 Arable land.* 

- Reeds mixed with trees (\> 5m) in rivers banks → *3.x.x.x Woodland and forest.* 

- Open water ≥ 0.5 ha in wetland areas (class *8.2.1.0 Natural lakes).*   

- Mesic/moist grasslands → *4.1.0.0 / 4.2.1.x Managed or semi natural grassland*  

- Marine wetlands such as salt marshes or salines → *7.2.x.x Coastal wetlands*   

- *Mires* with more than 30% of tree cover density are considered as *3.0.0.0 Woodland and forest.* 

- Inland exploited salines and extraction of sodium minerals in salt marshes, salt lakes or other locations → *1.3.1.0* *Mineral extraction, dump and construction sites*. 

- Shrub along river sides and on river banks (may include small patches of reeds with area \< 0.5 Ha) where neither climax tree-like forest formations nor grassland is detected (mainly located in areas of Mediterranean and continental climates with a summer season with warm-temperate & low precipitation) → *34.1.0 Transitional woodland and shrub.*

- Map orange brown-green/red-blue/Blue-grey areas as *7 Wetland.* 

- Map other neighbouring grassland areas as *4.2.1.0 Semi-natural grassland* (located in mesic environments).

[Special Case in Nordic Conditions]{.underline}:

- In the case of Nordic countries, when typical mire/peat structures cannot be seen in the satellite image/orthographic photo, it is difficult to determine if an area is peat producing or not. Therefore the position in the terrain is used for guidance. Areas directly adjacent to bigger rivers or lakes are included in *7.1.0.0 Inland marshes* when visual interpretation is insufficient. This is because of lower chances of peat production when oxygen from flowing water is supplied to the ecosystem as opposed to ecosystems adjacent to standing water.

- Non-peat producing wetlands with a low-growing vegetation of grasses and sedges are generally grazed/mowed. These areas are included in *7.1.0.0 Inland marshes*.

- Non-grazed/mowed and non-peat producing wetlands normally have a vegetation of tall grasses and sedges and are included in *7.1.0.0 Inland marshes*. Temporarily flooded areas with low grasses and sedges are included in *4.2.1.0 Semi-natural grassland* (located in mesic environments).

**Methodological Advice**:

- Main identification will be based on **CORINE Land Cover** class 4.1.1 and **Soils Map of Europe.**

- The existing knowledge on locations of large inland salines (Southern Europe, Pannonian Region or Turkey) will be taken into account and their surrounding ecosystems will be analyzed in order to detect possible occurrences of salines in class *7.1.0.0 Inland marshes.*

- The dividing line between the wetland and water classes is difficult to define without the contribution of images of different dates during the same year (in order to take into account the seasonality). The **HRL Water/Wetland Layers** may help to identify the boundaries between those two classes, but it should be noted that the pixel size of HR Layers is 20m and the production is based on the analysis of imagery corresponding to different years (2006-2009-2012-2018), not to different seasons.

- Other important datasets to detect these boundaries are **Natura 2000 Network** and **Wetland Ramsar Sites** databases. They are particularly relevant in the Mediterranean area and are highly recommended to use in the detection of Wetland Areas and Areas of Special Concern.

- Any available ancillary or in-situ data sources will also be used.

**7.1.2.2 Unexploited Peat Bog**

**Definition:** 

Open unexploited peat-producing wetlands that are not greatly affected by lakes, sea water or water from water courses. 

In Nordic conditions this class is normally a heterogeneous vegetation type where mire vegetation dominates in a mosaic of heath vegetation, alpine grassland, alpine willow bushes and a rocky ground.

Alternative names are proposed for this class as "Peat producing land" or "Peat bog and other peat producing land".

- Computer assisted visual interpretation of SPOT-5 data. 

- In Sweden classification is based on the Land survey Topographic map, where "wetland" and "open land" overlap. MAES wetland class is visually interpreted and adjusted manually. Adjustments of delineation are made only where obvious errors in ancillary are discernible in visual interpretation. When typical mire/peat structures cannot be seen in the image, it is difficult to determine if an area is peat producing or not. Therefore the position in the terrain is used for guidance. Areas directly adjacent to bigger rivers or lakes are included in *7.1.0.0 Inland marshes* when visual interpretation is insufficient. This is because of lower chances of peat production when oxygen from flowing water is supplied to the ecosystem as opposed to ecosystems adjacent to standing water. Grazed areas from LPIS that overlap wetland from the Topographic map are included in *7.1.0.0 Inland marshes*.

**7.2.1.0 Salt Marshes**

**Definition:** 

Coastal salt marshes, according to the EUNIS habitat description, are dominated by sediments and salt-tolerant stands of vegetation, occurring on the extreme upper shore of sheltered coasts and periodically covered by high tides. According to the definition of CLC class 5.2, Marine waters are oceanic and continental shelf waters, bays and narrow channels including sea lochs, fiords and straits. 

The class salt marshes includes according to EUNIS following habitat types: salt marsh drift lines, upper salt marshes, mid-upper salt marshes and saline brackish reed, rush and sedge beds and littoral sediments not included in 7.2.3 Intertidal flats or 6.2.1 Beaches and dunes.

The Estuaries class (8.3.2) includes marine waters not included in class 8.4.0 Sea and ocean or other lagoons and coastal wetlands classes.  

Vegetated low-lying coastal areas, above the high-tide line, susceptible to flooding by seawater. Often in the process of filling in, gradually being colonized by salt tolerant plants (saline reed beds). Salt marshes also appear without or less vegetation coverage.

On the date of the EO data of reference these areas may be covered or not by water. In this category, the entire marsh area will be considered as class 7.2.1, regardless if it is covered by water or not on the date of the image.

**8.1.1.0 Natural and semi-natural water Courses**

**Definition**

Natural stream of water that empties into another body of water or into the sea. Also water courses that cease to flow for part of the year, leaving a partially dry bed or water pools (EUNIS definition class C2.5) are included here. Different classes of temporary rivers are considered[^30]: snowmelt and glacier meltwater; perched and semi-perched alluvial; and karstic non-permanent streams.

Permanent running water courses occur throughout Europe, but are characteristic of well-watered areas as Atlantic and Continental biogeographical regions. In the Mediterranean region they are restricted to large water courses.

[Treatment of permanent/temporary separated water bodies belonging to the river system:]{.underline} 

In order to prevent mapping exceptional events such as floods, non-distinction should be applied between permanent and temporary separated water bodies belonging to the river system. Temporary separated water bodies belonging to the river system mainly correspond to riverine flooding covering old oxbows and other terrain depressions. In those areas, land may be covered with shallow, slow-moving floodwater for days or even weeks as exceptional situations. In these cases of temporary flooded areas, *permanent* land cover will be mapped (e.g. grasslands, wetlands or agricultural features).

![](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image395.png){fig-align="left"}

Map water course from auxiliary data; separate *8.1.3.0 Seasonally connected water courses (oxbows)* from *8.1.1.0 Natural & semi-natural water courses.* 

- If high water level, use auxiliary data to define river course, insert comment: „high water level" -- classified according to auxiliary data sets".

- If „normal"water level: extend *8.1.1.0 Natural & semi-natural water courses* and include *8.1.3.0 Seasonally connected water courses (oxbows)* into *8.1.1.0 Natural & semi-natural water courses* 

For complicated areas an experienced photo-interpreter should make an analysis and propose a mapping strategy in order to ensure a more or less „homogeneous" mapping of those areas

[Treatment of small temporary natural water bodies in special cases]{.underline}:

The category *8.2.1.0* *Natural lakes,* includes small temporary water bodies outside of the river bed and the river flood plain. These temporary water ponds are affected by a recurrent dry phase or are located in specific geomorphological sites such as karstic formations (e.g. turloughs in Scotland and Ireland or ponds in poljes and dolines in Balcanic countries and other karst sites in Europe). Here are not included temporary natural water bodies (ponds and lakes) related to wetland and coastal systems, temporal ponds within the river system, boreal snow-melt pools and ponds from abandoned or restored quarries.

These temporary ponds are characterized by their small size, inherently shallow and their variability related to the water permanency (in many Mediterranean locations these ponds contain water only during very humid years). Many of these ponds have been converted to arable land. New small ponds have been created across Europe for cattle watering using rainfall or underground water.

**8.3.1.0 Lagoons**

**Definition:** 

Lagoons (8.3.1) are, according to the EUNIS habitat classification, characterized by their chemical composition (presence of salt water) and their morphology (partially separated from the sea by sand banks or shingle, or, less frequently, by rocks). Coastal lagoons are vegetated (reed bed and salt marsh plants) or unvegetated.

CORINE Land Cover 521 Coastal lagoons is adopted: "Stretches of salt or brackish water in coastal areas which are separated from the sea by a tongue of land or other similar topography. These water bodies can be connected to the sea at limited points, either permanently or for parts of the year only" .

Coastal lagoons are considered as a water ecosystem composed by water and specific adapted vegetation (reed beds and marsh plants). Coastal lagoons also appear without or less vegetation coverage.

This category is relevant in Mediterranean coastal areas. This class is also present in Baltic sea and is a scarce habitat at the Atlantic coast.

![Orbetello Lake (Grosseto, Italy). Credits: European Union 2012, LUCAS.](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image414.jpeg){fig-align="left"}

***This category includes:*** 

- Open water of coastal lagoons. 

- Reed beds in coastal lagoons. 

- Floating aquatic vegetation in coastal lagoons.

- Tidal mud flats and muddy areas in coastal lagoons.

- Tidal channels. 

- Areas separated by barriers in coastal lagoons and not included in salines or fish farms.

- Coastal lagoons separated from the sea by rocks if they are distinguishable from fjords and other related features. This type is common for the coasts of Scotland, Wales and Ireland (silted or chocked coastal lagoons).

- Percolation lagoons if they are clearly separated from sea by sand banks or shingle.

- Coastal lagoons separated from the sea by artificial structures, as roads. 

***This category excludes:***

**Attributes:**

- N/A  

**Appearance:**  

Un-vegetated (water coverage) water bodies generally separated from the sea by a land barrier (usually sand).

![Schematic representation of typical coastal lagoon landscape.](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image416.png){fig-align="left"}

Muddy areas in coastal lagoons will be considered also as *8.3.1.0 Lagoons* (including muddy areas separated from the main lagoons by barrier and not included in salines or fish farms).

![Schematic view of the treatment of bare soils in coastal lagoons](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image417.png){fig-align="left"}

The following types of coastal lagoons are considered according their main morphological characteristics:  

![Schematic view of La Albufera coastal lagoon (Valencia, Spain)](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image418.png){fig-align="left"}

- **Isolated lagoons**: These are shallow bodies of water separated from the sea by a sand barrier (dunes and beaches). These lagoons are connected to the sea at limited points. Typical of Mediterranean coastal areas. In Spain called *Albuferas*.

In many cases, these coastal lagoons separated by sand barriers, are open to the sea due to sea erosion or other processes (**leaky, restricted or open type lagoons**). In other cases they are surrounded completely by sand banks. Many of these lagoons are man-made transformed (especially by the construction of roads on the sand barriers).

![Schematic view of Falsterbo coastal lagoons complex (Scania Province, Sweden)](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image420.png){fig-align="left"}

![Schematic view of a transformed coastal lagoon. Logarou lake (Greece).](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image4211.png){fig-align="left"}

**Percolation lagoons**[^32]: These are normally separated from the sea by sand or shingle banks. Seawater enters by percolating through the bank.

![Schematic view of percolation Cemlyn lagoon (north Wales, United Kingdom)](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image4212.png){fig-align="left"}

A specific case of coastal lagoons are **silled or choked lagoons**. These coastal lagoons are open to the sea, but the water is retained by a rock barrier (in many cases not visible in the satellite images) or by a long narrow entrance channel. Fjords are the same landform but in this case the difference from choked coastal lagoons is the water depth.

- Use of Transitional Water layer (European Framework Directive) to identify general limits of coastal waters. 

- Use of ancillary information: 

  - HRL Water/Wetland Layers.

Reed and vegetated areas in coastal lagoons areas are considered as *8.1.1.0 Salt marshes.*

![Limnes Voulkaria Kai Saltini Natura 2000 site, Greece. SPOT-5 (2.5 m) (1/2/3 band combination). Date: 2011-02-05. Source: CNES 2011©, Distribution Airbus DS/Spot Image.](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image4214.png){fig-align="left"}

Marshes could be located in following situations in coastal lagoons:

  A.  Reed beds and marsh plants inside coastal lagoons. 
  
  B.  Reed beds and marsh plants located in the shoreline of coastal lagoons. 
  
  C.  Reed beds and marsh plants dividing two coastal lagoons. 
  
  D.  Reed beds and marsh plants separated from coastal lagoons not related with estuaries or coastal lagoons.

In the case of complex coastal lagoons (costal lagoons related to coastal wetlands and estuaries) vegetation (reed beds and marsh plants) will be classified as *7.2.1.0 Salt marshes.*

![Concept of coastal marshes: A, B, C and D situations are considered as 8.1.1.0 Coastal salt marshes](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image421.png){fig-align="left"}

![Schematic concept for differentiation between 8.2.1.0/8.1.1.0 classes](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image4221.png){fig-align="left"}

Special cases are coastal lagoons covered by reed bed and marsh plants and the presence of a tidal channel. In these cases the tidal channels will be classified as *8.3.1.0 Lagoons.*

**8.3.2.0 Estuaries**

**Definition**

CORINE Land Cover 522 Estuaries class is adopted: "*The mouth of a river within which the tide ebbs and flows, either permanently or for parts of the year only*"[^33]. 

In many cases, estuaries are associated with marshes. 

![Estuary of Guadalquivir River (Southern Spain). Credits: E. Mazón](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image422.jpeg){fig-align="left"}

***This category includes:*** 

- Estuaries. 

- Deltas.

***This category excludes:***

- Marshes in estuaries → *7.2.1.0 Salt marshes.*

- Coastal waters → *8.4. Sea and ocean.*

- Coastal lagoons→ *8.3.1.0* *Coastal lagoons*.

- Rivers ending in highly artificial harbors will not be categorized as *8.3.2.0* *Estuaries*.

- Fjords, *rias* (in Northwestern Spain) and straits → *8.4 Sea and ocean.*  

**Attributes:** 

- N/A  

**Appearance:**

Ending of rivers which flow into the sea.  

Estuaries are influenced by tides and in small rivers sand/mud appears when low tide occurs.

![Gironde Estuary delineated (France). SPOT-5 (2.5 m) (1/2/3 Band Combination). Date: 2011-08-01 Source: CNES 2011©, Distribution Airbus DS/Spot Image.](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image423.jpeg){fig-align="left"}

![Schematic representation of typical estuary morphology](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image424.png){fig-align="left"}

In delta rivers, the area where the river meets the sea is classified as *8.3.2.0* *Estuaries*. The area affected by tides (presence of mud in the image) inside the deltaic system and not covered by vegetation is also classified as *8.3.2.0* *Estuaries.*

![Axios Delta (Greece). SPOT-5 (2.5 m) (1/2/3 Band Combination). Date: 2011-09-17. Source: CNES 2011©, Distribution Airbus DS/Spot Image.](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image426.png){fig-align="left"}

![Schematic representation of RZ level 4 classification of Axios Delta (Greece)](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image4262.png){fig-align="left"}

The limits between 8.1.1 *Natural and semi-natural water courses* and *8.3.2.0* *Estuaries* is based in the following practical visual rules:  

![](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image4263.png){fig-align="left"}

- There is a clear narrowing of the river channel → the limits is established where the river begins to be wider. Usually, there are muddy areas from this point.

-----

![](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image4264.png){fig-align="left"}

- The estuary is formed by a river and a major tributary and the river begins to be wider → the limit is the confluent of two rivers. 

------

![](./Riparian_Zones_media/media/image4265.png){fig-align="left"}

- In deltas and at big rivers where no difference in the width of the channel is apparent and salt marshes or complex coastal systems are present → the limit is the point where wet mud banks forming salt marshes or old wetlands transformed by agriculture appear.

--------

**Methodological Advice:** 

- Computer assisted visual interpretation complemented by ancillary information. The delimitation *8.3.2.0* *Estuaries* / *8.1* *Water courses* will be determined by the photo-interpreter according to morphological characteristics as e.g. river junctions or other geographic elements as bare or sandy capes.  

- CORINE Land cover class 522 Estuaries.
