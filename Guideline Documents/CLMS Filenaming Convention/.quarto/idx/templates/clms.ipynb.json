Web crawling and Information Provisioning for Generative Chatbots\nWeb crawling is the process used by search engines to explore and index the web pages of websites. The crawler downloads pages, reads the content, and adds it to the search engine's index. Crawlers are designed to navigate from one page to another by following hyperlinks, allowing them to efficiently cover a website's entire structure. Search engines rely on crawlers to keep their results up-to-date by regularly visiting websites and checking for new or modified content. **Googlebot**, **Bingbot**, and **Yahoo Slurp** are some example of popular web crawlers. Key terms involved in web crawling are:\n\n- **Search engine**: A system that allows users to search for content on the web.\n- **Indexing**: The process of storing web content so it can be retrieved later.\n- **Web pages**: Documents that make up the web, interconnected by hyperlinks.\n- **Hyperlinks**: Links that connect different web pages, forming a navigable web.\n\nWeb crawling has become essential for search engines and AI applications. The integration of these technologies has been explored extensively [@khder2021web; @massimino2016accessing; @kausar2013web; @saini2016information]. The growth of digital content has placed significant demands on the efficiency and accuracy of web crawlers and artificial intelligence (AI) models [@hernandez2019deep; @deshmukh2021survey]. In response, Content Lifecycle Management Standards (CLMS) are essential for establishing uniformity in the way data is formatted, structured, and exposed for automated tools like crawlers and AI training datasets. CLMS helps ensure that content is easy to access, interpret, and process, leading to more accurate information retrieval and AI model training. This document outlines the development of CLMS standards for exposing information to web crawlers and optimizing the formatting for AI data ingestion. @fig-ai-training focuses on the working of a web crawler [@Crawl].\n\n![Diagram illustrating web crawling [@Crawl].](images/web_crawling_diagram.png){width=65% align=\"center\" #fig-ai-training}\n\nIn recent years, generative chatbots have made great progress and become powerful tools that allow users to access detailed information and conduct complex queries. In particular, chatbots can help users explore certain aspects of CLMS products, such as allocation rules or the purpose of a particular product. These tools are not only critical for product discoverability, but also improve user understanding of CLMS products. To ensure that chatbots effectively help users find and understand CLMS products, it is important that the underlying information is formatted and presented in a way that is easy to find and use. This requires well-structured documentation and a system that allows web crawlers and AI models to effectively access and process CLMS data.\n\nWeb crawlers and AI models are critical to the discoverability of online information. Web crawlers that index websites rely on well-structured content to perform their tasks effectively. Similarly, generative AI models, including chatbots, require high-quality structured data to produce accurate and meaningful results. CLMS provides important environmental data, but in order for this data to be useful to AI models and easy for users to find, it must be properly formatted and made available.\n\n### 1.3.1. Motivation\nThe relationship between AI and web crawlers has led to new frontiers in both industries. The primary motivation for creating CLMS standards lies in the need for:\n\n- **Improved Crawling Efficiency**: Properly formatted content with metadata helps crawlers index relevant information faster and more accurately.\n  \n- **Better AI Model Training**: Consistent content structure ensures that AI models are trained on high-quality, organized data.\n\n- **Data Accessibility**: Standardizing the structure of content ensures that information is universally accessible across platforms.\n\nThe following key aspects are critical for ensuring that data is structured and accessible for web crawlers and AI systems:\n\n- **Uniform metadata**: Consistent metadata usage across all content is essential. Metadata includes details like title, author, keywords, and publication date. Uniform metadata ensures that web crawlers and AI systems can easily index and categorize content, improving searchability and discoverability.\n\n- **Clearly defined content sections**: Content should be organized into distinct sections, such as titles, headings, and subheadings. This structured format helps both users and machines navigate through the content efficiently, making key information easy to locate and retrieve.\n\n\n- **Embedded structured data formats**: Incorporating structured data formats such as **JSON-LD**, **RDF**, or **XML** provides a precise way of representing information. These formats help web crawlers and AI systems understand relationships and attributes within the content, facilitating accurate extraction, interpretation, and use of the data across various platforms.\n\n### 1.3.2. Importance\n- **Enhanced Web Crawling**: Properly structured CLMS content will improve web crawlers' ability to index and retrieve information.\n\n- **Improved AI Training**: Structured data ensures higher-quality datasets, which result in better-trained AI models, particularly for generative chatbots.\n\n- **Better User Experience**: By improving product discoverability and findability, users will have an easier time accessing and understanding CLMS products.\n   \n:::{.callout-tip}\nGiven the growing complexity of CLMS products and the increasing reliance on generative AI tools, it is critical to implement standards that improve the discoverability and usability of CLMS data.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-note}\nBy standardizing the format and delivery of CLMS information, our goal is to ensure that generative AI applications, such as web crawlers and chatbots, can effectively access and use this data.\n:::\n\n# 2. Content Standards\nDeveloping content standards requires collaboration between content creators, data engineers, and AI researchers. The process typically follows these stages for different document types in use:\n\n## 2.1. Content Structuring\nContent structuring involves organizing data into recognizable, standard components, such as:\n\n- **Title**: Main identifier of the content.\n\n- **Metadata**: Information about the content, including authors, dates, keywords, and relevant classification.\n\n- **Headings and Subheadings**: Structured sections that break down the content into digestible parts.\n\nThe example of Metadata formatting has been given below:\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Developing CLMS Standards for Generative AI Training and Web Crawlers\"\nsubtitle: \"Task 10.1: Information Provisioning for Generative Chatbots\"\nauthor: \"Ayan Chatterjee, Department of DIGITAL, NILU, ayan@nilu.no.\"\ndate: \"2024-09-10\"\nsitemap: true           #Enables sitemap generation for web crawlers\ntoc: true              # Enable the Table of Contents\ntoc-title: \"Index\"      # Customize the title of the table of contents\ntoc-depth: 3            # Include headings up to level 3 (###)\nkeywords: [\"CLMS standards\", \"web crawlers\", \"AI training\", \"information formatting\"]\nbibliography: references.bib   # Link to the bibliography file\ncsl: ieee.csl                  # Link to the CSL file for IEEE style\nformat: \n  html: default\n  pdf: default\n  docx: default\n---\n```\n\n## 2.2. HTML Structuring\nThe following structured approach in HTML allows web crawlers to effectively index and retrieve content while facilitating AI training for generative models, ensuring that information is both accessible and usable:\n\n### 2.2.1. Semantic Structuring and Formatting\n\nIt is used to enhance both **machine readability** and **user comprehension**, we must follow structured and semantic formatting principles. This includes using HTML5 elements, schema markup, and providing clear metadata. Using HTML5 semantic elements like `<article>`, `<section>`, `<header>`, and `<footer>` helps structure the document meaningfully. For example:\n\n```html\n<article>\n  <header>\n    <h1>Understanding Web Crawlers</h1>\n    <meta name=\"description\" content=\"How web crawlers work and index ..!\" />\n  </header>\n  <section>\n    <h2>How Crawlers Index Content</h2>\n    <p>Web crawlers use semantic structure to efficiently index web pages.</p>\n  </section>\n  <footer>\n    <p>Author: Ayan Chatterjee</p>\n  </footer>\n</article>\n```\n\n### 2.2.2. Microdata for Enhancing Machine Readability\n\nMicrodata attributes such as itemscope, itemtype, and itemprop provide semantic clarity for machines, enabling more efficient crawling and interpretation.\n\n```html\n<article itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/Article\">\n  <header>\n    <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">Web Crawling Explained</h1>\n    <meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\"How web crawlers index ..?\" />\n  </header>\n</article>\n```\n### 2.2.3. Schema Markup for Structured Content\nUse Schema Markup (like ResearchArticle, Dataset, or CreativeWork) to define the content type and enhance machine readability. This helps both web crawlers and AI to categorize content accurately.\n\n```html\n<article itemscope itemtype=\"https://schema.org/ResearchArticle\">\n  <header>\n    <h1 itemprop=\"headline\">AI Training for Web Crawlers</h1>\n    <meta itemprop=\"description\" content=\" AI training techniques for ..\" />\n  </header>\n</article>\n```\n### 2.2.4. Headings and Subheadings\nProvide clearly defined headings and subheadings to organize content for easier navigation and indexing by crawlers.\n\n```yaml\n---\n# How AI Models are Trained\n## Data Collection\n## Model Training\n## Evaluation\n---\n```\n\n### 2.2.5. Alt Text and Descriptions\nFor images and diagrams, always provide alt text and descriptions to improve accessibility.\n\n```yaml\n![A diagram illustrating how web crawlers work]\n(images/web_crawlers.png){alt=\"A diagram of web crawler processes\" width=50%}\n```\n\n### 2.2.6. Meta Tags and Descriptions\nAdd meta tags and descriptions to help web crawlers index the content more accurately\n\n```yaml\n<meta name=\"description\" content=\"How web crawlers work effectively!\" />\n```\n\n### 2.2.7. Phrasing and Content Presentation\nEnsure that important keywords are present in titles, headings, and throughout the content without overusing them (avoid keyword stuffing).\n\n```yaml\n# Introduction to Web Crawlers and AI Training\nWeb crawlers, also known as spiders, are used by search engines to index web ...\n```\n\nWrite in a clear and concise manner. Avoid jargon unless necessary, and ensure that key concepts are easy to understand.\n\n```yaml\nWeb crawlers automatically scan websites to collect and index content. \nThey follow links, downloading web pages and saving them for future queries.\n```\n\nUse hyperlinks and cross-references to guide both users and web crawlers to related content.\n\n```yaml\nFor more details, see the [Introduction to AI Training](#data-collection).\n```\n\nProvide a brief abstract or summary at the beginning of each article or section for better clarity and indexing.\n\n```yaml\n**Summary:** This article provides an overview of indexing content, \nand their integration with AI.\n```\n\n### 2.2.8. Structured Data Repositories\nIt is used to enable knowledge transfer to generative AI, use standardized formats like JSON-LD, RDF, or XML to define metadata and structure.\n\n```yaml\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"Dataset\",\n  \"name\": \"AI Training Dataset\",\n  \"description\": \"A dataset designed to improve search engine crawlers.\"\n}\n```\n\n```yaml\n<dataset xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance\" type=\"AI Training Dataset\">\n  <name>AI Training Dataset</name>\n  <description>A dataset designed for training AI models.</description>\n</dataset>\n```\n\n## 2.3. PDF Structuring\nThe following structured approach in PDF will improve documents for indexing by web crawlers, integration with AI systems, and overall improved accessibility for users:\n\n### 2.3.1. Accessible PDF Formats by Tagging\nEnsure that the PDF is tagged properly so that screen readers and AI tools can interpret the document structure. For instance, headings, paragraphs, and lists should be tagged semantically.\n\n```yaml\n# Heading 1 (tagged as <h1>)\n- List item 1 (tagged as <ul><li>)\n```\n\n### 2.3.2. Structuring and Formatting\nThe document structure should be accessible, with a clear hierarchy and a clickable table of contents (TOC). Accessible tagging, hierarchical organization, and text over image improve the usability for both humans and machines.\n\nOrganize content into a well-defined hierarchy using headings (#, ##, ###). This improves both user navigation and machine parsing for AI and web crawlers.\n\n```yaml\n## Section 1: Introduction\n### Subsection 1.1: Overview\n\ntoc: true\ntoc-depth: 2\n```\n\n### 2.3.3. Adding Metadata\nEmbedding metadata such as document properties (e.g., Title, Author, Subject, and Keywords), XMP metadata, Schema.org metadata, and descriptive metadata helps search engines and AI systems index, categorize, and retrieve information efficiently. \n\n```yaml\ntitle: \"PDF Structuring and Formatting\"\nauthor: \"Ayan Chatterjee\"\nsubject: \"Document Accessibility and Metadata\"\nkeywords: [\"PDF accessibility\", \"metadata\", \"AI integration\"]\n```\n\nXMP metadata is stored as XML in the PDF file, allowing for rich data descriptions. Schema.org metadata in JSON-LD provide structured information that AI and web crawlers can easily understand. \n\n```yaml\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"CreativeWork\",\n  \"name\": \"PDF Structuring and Formatting\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Person\",\n    \"name\": \"Jane Doe\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [\"PDF accessibility\", \"metadata\", \"AI integration\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 2.3.4. Optimizing Content Presentation\nEnsuring the proper placement of keywords, providing alt text for images, and correctly labeling figures and tables contribute to the searchability and accessibility of the content. This is crucial for effective interaction with web crawlers and AI models.\n\n```yaml\nKeywords: PDF accessibility, web crawlers, generative AI\n![A flowchart showing the PDF processing workflow](path/to/image.png){alt=\"PDF workflow\"}\n![Figure 1: A table of contents structure](path/to/image.png){#fig-toc}\n```\n\n### 2.3.5. Setting Up for Knowledge Transfer to Generative AI\nUsing machine-readable fonts (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman), a clean and simple layout, and adding comments or annotations helps prepare the document for use in generative AI systems. AI models benefit from well-structured and easy-to-parse content, which improves their ability to understand and generate meaningful responses based on the content.\n\n```yaml\n## Section 1: Overview\nThis section introduces the importance of accessible PDFs for AI processing...\n\n<!-- This annotation explains the role of hierarchical metadata for AI -->\n```\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nBy such structured practices, we can ensure that the content is both human-readable and machine-readable, facilitating easy discovery by web crawlers and seamless integration with AI training systems.\n:::\n\n# 3.

Recommended Standards for Information Formatting\n## 4.1. Suggested Standards\nOne of the main challenges in this task is improving the findability and discoverability of CLMS products. With the extensive range of data and services offered by CLMS, users often struggle to locate specific datasets or resources. Chatbots serve as a potential solution by guiding users to the appropriate resources. For chatbots to effectively perform this role, the data must be properly structured, categorized, and indexed. To support this:\n\n- Documentation must be **accessible to third-party chatbots**. While CLMS chatbots will be the primary interaction point, external platforms should also access and retrieve relevant data. Exposing CLMS data in a structured and standardized format ensures interoperability across various chatbot systems, enhancing discoverability.\n\n- Recommendations will be provided on how CLMS should **format and expose information**. These guidelines will focus on best practices for metadata structuring, content organization, and linkable resources to optimize data formatting.\n\nThe recommended standards for CLMS will include the use of Quarto Markdown, sitemaps, and structured metadata for web crawlers and AI systems. \n\n- **Using Quarto Markdown for Data Structuring**: Quarto Markdown allows for the clear organization of data, with structured sections such as headings, subheadings, and metadata fields. This makes it easier for web crawlers and AI systems to navigate the content and retrieve relevant information. Additionally, by using cross-referencing within Quarto Markdown documents, CLMS products and resources can be interconnected, providing users with a more seamless exploration experience.\n\n- **Implementing Sitemaps for Efficient Crawling**: Sitemaps provide a roadmap for web crawlers, ensuring that all relevant pages and data sources are indexed. By creating comprehensive sitemaps that expose the entirety of the CLMS data repository, the task ensures that web crawlers and AI systems can efficiently discover and retrieve content. This is essential for making CLMS data easily accessible to third-party chatbots and AI platforms.\n\n## 4.2. Guideline for the Process Verification\nWe can compare the results of the search queries for both the unformatted and formatted documents. Typically, formatted documents with clear structure and metadata should provide better search accuracy because they provide more semantic meaning and context, making it easier for the search engine to retrieve relevant information. In this sub-section, we have outlined a step-by-step process for preparing and indexing documents to improve search accuracy. The focus is on comparing unformatted documents to formatted ones using Quarto Markdown, and how sitemap integration enhances search engine results.\n\n- Step 1: Document Preparation\n    - Create **unformatted text**, **PDF**, or **Markdown files**.\n    - Create **formatted documents** using **Quarto**, which include metadata, clear headings, and semantic structure.\n\n- Step 2: Sitemap Generation\n    - For the formatted documents, generate a **sitemap** in XML format.\n    - The sitemap should list all document URLs along with relevant metadata (e.g., last modified date, frequency of changes).\n\n- Step 3: Set Up Search Engine\n    - Choose a simple search engine library, such as **Whoosh**.\n    - Create a **search index** for both sets of documents (formatted and unformatted).\n    - Ensure that metadata is included in the search index for the formatted documents.\n\n- Step 4: Develop Web Crawler\n    - Write a simple **web crawler** to crawl both unformatted and formatted documents.\n    - For the formatted documents, ensure the crawler uses the **sitemap** to guide the indexing process.\n\n- Step 5: Test Search Accuracy\n    - Perform search queries for common terms in both unformatted and formatted datasets.\n    - Measure the relevance of search results using metrics like **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.\n\n- Step 6: Analyze Results\n    - Compare the performance of the search engine on unformatted versus formatted documents.\n    - **Hypothesis**: Documents with structure and a sitemap will produce better search accuracy, yielding higher relevance in the results.\n\nThis Quarto Markdown setup can be used in a Jupyter notebook (ipynb) under a single section, maintaining clarity and structure in both the notebook and final rendered outputs (e.g., HTML, PDF, or DOCX).\n\n# 5. Conclusion\nThe **European Environment Agency (EEA)** recognizes the growing need for generative chatbots and natural language analysis tools to facilitate easy access to CLMS data. In response, the EEA is undertaking preparatory efforts to establish the necessary standards and infrastructure for successful chatbot integration.

Web crawling and Information Provisioning for Generative Chatbots\nWeb crawling is the process used by search engines to explore and index the web pages of websites. The crawler downloads pages, reads the content, and adds it to the search engine's index. Crawlers are designed to navigate from one page to another by following hyperlinks, allowing them to efficiently cover a website's entire structure. Search engines rely on crawlers to keep their results up-to-date by regularly visiting websites and checking for new or modified content. **Googlebot**, **Bingbot**, and **Yahoo Slurp** are some example of popular web crawlers. Key terms involved in web crawling are:\n\n- **Search engine**: A system that allows users to search for content on the web.\n- **Indexing**: The process of storing web content so it can be retrieved later.\n- **Web pages**: Documents that make up the web, interconnected by hyperlinks.\n- **Hyperlinks**: Links that connect different web pages, forming a navigable web.\n\nWeb crawling has become essential for search engines and AI applications. The integration of these technologies has been explored extensively [@khder2021web; @massimino2016accessing; @kausar2013web; @saini2016information]. The growth of digital content has placed significant demands on the efficiency and accuracy of web crawlers and artificial intelligence (AI) models [@hernandez2019deep; @deshmukh2021survey]. In response, Content Lifecycle Management Standards (CLMS) are essential for establishing uniformity in the way data is formatted, structured, and exposed for automated tools like crawlers and AI training datasets. CLMS helps ensure that content is easy to access, interpret, and process, leading to more accurate information retrieval and AI model training. This document outlines the development of CLMS standards for exposing information to web crawlers and optimizing the formatting for AI data ingestion. @fig-ai-training focuses on the working of a web crawler [@Crawl].\n\n![Diagram illustrating web crawling [@Crawl].](images/web_crawling_diagram.png){width=65% align=\"center\" #fig-ai-training}\n\nIn recent years, generative chatbots have made great progress and become powerful tools that allow users to access detailed information and conduct complex queries. In particular, chatbots can help users explore certain aspects of CLMS products, such as allocation rules or the purpose of a particular product. These tools are not only critical for product discoverability, but also improve user understanding of CLMS products. To ensure that chatbots effectively help users find and understand CLMS products, it is important that the underlying information is formatted and presented in a way that is easy to find and use. This requires well-structured documentation and a system that allows web crawlers and AI models to effectively access and process CLMS data.\n\nWeb crawlers and AI models are critical to the discoverability of online information. Web crawlers that index websites rely on well-structured content to perform their tasks effectively. Similarly, generative AI models, including chatbots, require high-quality structured data to produce accurate and meaningful results. CLMS provides important environmental data, but in order for this data to be useful to AI models and easy for users to find, it must be properly formatted and made available.\n\n### 1.3.1.

Structuring and Formatting\nThe document structure should be accessible, with a clear hierarchy and a clickable table of contents (TOC). Accessible tagging, hierarchical organization, and text over image improve the usability for both humans and machines.\n\nOrganize content into a well-defined hierarchy using headings (#, ##, ###). This improves both user navigation and machine parsing for AI and web crawlers.\n\n```yaml\n## Section 1: Introduction\n### Subsection 1.1: Overview\n\ntoc: true\ntoc-depth: 2\n```\n\n### 2.3.3. Adding Metadata\nEmbedding metadata such as document properties (e.g., Title, Author, Subject, and Keywords), XMP metadata, Schema.org metadata, and descriptive metadata helps search engines and AI systems index, categorize, and retrieve information efficiently. \n\n```yaml\ntitle: \"PDF Structuring and Formatting\"\nauthor: \"Ayan Chatterjee\"\nsubject: \"Document Accessibility and Metadata\"\nkeywords: [\"PDF accessibility\", \"metadata\", \"AI integration\"]\n```\n\nXMP metadata is stored as XML in the PDF file, allowing for rich data descriptions. Schema.org metadata in JSON-LD provide structured information that AI and web crawlers can easily understand. \n\n```yaml\n{\n  \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\",\n  \"@type\": \"CreativeWork\",\n  \"name\": \"PDF Structuring and Formatting\",\n  \"author\": {\n    \"@type\": \"Person\",\n    \"name\": \"Jane Doe\"\n  },\n  \"keywords\": [\"PDF accessibility\", \"metadata\", \"AI integration\"]\n}\n```\n\n### 2.3.4. Optimizing Content Presentation\nEnsuring the proper placement of keywords, providing alt text for images, and correctly labeling figures and tables contribute to the searchability and accessibility of the content. This is crucial for effective interaction with web crawlers and AI models.\n\n```yaml\nKeywords: PDF accessibility, web crawlers, generative AI\n![A flowchart showing the PDF processing workflow](path/to/image.png){alt=\"PDF workflow\"}\n![Figure 1: A table of contents structure](path/to/image.png){#fig-toc}\n```\n\n### 2.3.5. Setting Up for Knowledge Transfer to Generative AI\nUsing machine-readable fonts (e.g., Arial, Times New Roman), a clean and simple layout, and adding comments or annotations helps prepare the document for use in generative AI systems. AI models benefit from well-structured and easy-to-parse content, which improves their ability to understand and generate meaningful responses based on the content.\n\n```yaml\n## Section 1: Overview\nThis section introduces the importance of accessible PDFs for AI processing...\n\n<!-- This annotation explains the role of hierarchical metadata for AI -->\n```\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nBy such structured practices, we can ensure that the content is both human-readable and machine-readable, facilitating easy discovery by web crawlers and seamless integration with AI training systems.\n:::\n\n# 3.

Indexing\nProper indexing is essential for increasing the discoverability and accessibility of CLMS products [@hassan2014improving; @coe2016website]. By formatting documents using Quarto Markdown and generating a sitemap.xml, we can ensure that search engines and AI systems efficiently crawl and retrieve CLMS content [@hassan2014improving; @coe2016website]. Top improve document indexing for enhanced discoverability and accessibility we can adopt the following approaches:\n\n- Organize content using **structured headers** and **metadata** in Quarto Markdown.\n- Use proper keywords and descriptions in the document metadata.\n- Cross-reference related documents to create interconnected content that helps crawlers navigate.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"Land Use Mapping with CLMS Data\"\nauthor: \"Ayan Chatterjee\"\ndate: \"2024-08-01\"\nkeywords: [\"land use\", \"CLMS\", \"mapping\", \"environment\"]\ndescription: \"A detailed report on how CLMS data.\"\n---\n```\n\n### 3.3.1. Sitemap Generation\nA sitemap.xml helps web crawlers discover all the content on the website [@hassan2014improving; @coe2016website]. By providing a clear roadmap, crawlers can index each document, ensuring that all CLMS resources are available for search and AI training. By using **Quarto Markdown** and generating a **sitemap.xml**, CLMS documents can be structured in a way that improves their **indexing**, making them more **discoverable** by search engines and AI systems. This approach ensures efficient crawling, improves search engine ranking, and enhances the accessibility of CLMS products for users and AI models alike.\n\n- **Search Engine Discoverability**: Users and AI systems can easily find the indexed CLMS documents.\n- **Efficient Crawling**: The sitemap provides a roadmap, allowing for faster and more accurate indexing.\n- **Increased Accessibility**: Properly indexed documents are easier for users and AI to retrieve and utilize, improving the overall product visibility.\n\n```html\n<urlset xmlns=\"http://www.sitemaps.org/schemas/sitemap/0.9\">\n   <url>\n      <loc>http://example.com/clms/land-use-mapping</loc>\n      <lastmod>2024-08-01</lastmod>\n      <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>\n   </url>\n   <url>\n      <loc>http://example.com/clms/land-cover-change</loc>\n      <lastmod>2024-07-15</lastmod>\n      <changefreq>monthly</changefreq>\n   </url>\n</urlset>\n```\n\n### 3.3.2. Steps to Implement and Submit the Sitemap\n- **Generate the Sitemap**: Use a sitemap generator tool (e.g., XML-Sitemaps or Screaming Frog) to create a sitemap, or have it generated automatically by a CMS like WordPress or a static site generator like Hugo.\n\n- **Upload the Sitemap**: Once generated, place the sitemap.xml file in the root directory of your website, e.g., https://www.example.com/sitemap.xml.\n\n- **Submit to Search Engines**: Submit your sitemap to search engines via tools like Google Search Console and Bing Webmaster Tools. This helps search engines index your site properly.\n\n### 3.3.3. Enhancing Indexing for Web Crawlers and AI Models\nTo ensure that CLMS documents are findable and accessible to web crawlers and AI models, it's important to implement proper steps for generating and submitting a sitemap and using structured data (such as metadata and JSON-LD) to enhance indexing. \n\n- **Descriptive Filenames**: Use filenames that clearly describe the content of the document. For instance, instead of doc1.md, use clms-land-monitoring-data.md.\n\n- **Metadata**: Add descriptive metadata in your Quarto Markdown files (e.g., title, author, keywords). This helps search engines and AI models understand the content better.\n\n- **Text Content**: Ensure that text content is descriptive and structured using headings and subheadings to guide crawlers.\n\n- **HTML Metadata and JSON-LD Structured Data**: Use HTML metadata and JSON-LD structured data within the Quarto document to improve how your content is indexed by search engines and used by AI training systems.\n\nThe following Quarto Markdown YAML header example demonstrates how to enhance document visibility for web crawling and AI training by including metadata and structured data. This can be part of your CLMS documentation to ensure that it is well-indexed and easy to discover.\n\n```yaml\n---\ntitle: \"CLMS Land Monitoring Data\"\nauthor: \"Ayan Chatterjee\"\ndate: \"2024-09-15\"\nkeywords: [\"CLMS\", \"web crawling\", \"AI training\", \"environmental data\"]\ndescription: \"Comprehensive overview of CLMS land monitoring datasets, ......\"\nsitemap: true  # Flag to include this document in the sitemap\n\n# HTML metadata for SEO and discoverability\nmeta:\n  - name: \"description\"\n    content: \"CLMS land monitoring datasets for environmental and climate ...\"\n  - name: \"keywords\"\n    content: \"CLMS, land monitoring, environmental data, AI, web crawling\"\n\n# JSON-LD structured data to help search engines and AI understand the content\njson-ld:\n  - \"@context\": \"https://schema.org\"\n    \"@type\": \"Dataset\"\n    \"name\": \"CLMS Land Monitoring Data\"\n    \"description\": \"Detailed data on land monitoring and ....\"\n    \"url\": \"https://www.example.com/clms-land-monitoring-data\"\n    \"keywords\": \"land monitoring, environmental data, AI training..\"\n    \"datePublished\": \"2024-09-15\"\n    \"creator\":\n      \"@type\": \"Organization\"\n      \"name\": \"Copernicus Land Monitoring Service\"\n    \"publisher\":\n      \"@type\": \"Organization\"\n      \"name\": \"European Environment Agency\"\n---\n```\n\n:::{.callout-important}\n**Quarto** stands out as the most versatile tool for creating CLMS-compliant documents, with cross-language support, integration of code, multiple output formats, and the ability to generate static websites.\n:::\n\n:::{.callout-important}\nTo ensure that CLMS documents are findable and accessible to web crawlers and AI models, it's important to implement proper steps for generating and submitting a sitemap and using structured data (such as metadata and JSON-LD) to enhance indexing.\n:::\n\n# 4. Recommended Standards for Information Formatting\n## 4.1. Suggested Standards\nOne of the main challenges in this task is improving the findability and discoverability of CLMS products. With the extensive range of data and services offered by CLMS, users often struggle to locate specific datasets or resources. Chatbots serve as a potential solution by guiding users to the appropriate resources. For chatbots to effectively perform this role, the data must be properly structured, categorized, and indexed. To support this:\n\n- Documentation must be **accessible to third-party chatbots**. While CLMS chatbots will be the primary interaction point, external platforms should also access and retrieve relevant data. Exposing CLMS data in a structured and standardized format ensures interoperability across various chatbot systems, enhancing discoverability.\n\n- Recommendations will be provided on how CLMS should **format and expose information**. These guidelines will focus on best practices for metadata structuring, content organization, and linkable resources to optimize data formatting.\n\nThe recommended standards for CLMS will include the use of Quarto Markdown, sitemaps, and structured metadata for web crawlers and AI systems. \n\n- **Using Quarto Markdown for Data Structuring**: Quarto Markdown allows for the clear organization of data, with structured sections such as headings, subheadings, and metadata fields. This makes it easier for web crawlers and AI systems to navigate the content and retrieve relevant information. Additionally, by using cross-referencing within Quarto Markdown documents, CLMS products and resources can be interconnected, providing users with a more seamless exploration experience.\n\n- **Implementing Sitemaps for Efficient Crawling**: Sitemaps provide a roadmap for web crawlers, ensuring that all relevant pages and data sources are indexed. By creating comprehensive sitemaps that expose the entirety of the CLMS data repository, the task ensures that web crawlers and AI systems can efficiently discover and retrieve content. This is essential for making CLMS data easily accessible to third-party chatbots and AI platforms.\n\n## 4.2. Guideline for the Process Verification\nWe can compare the results of the search queries for both the unformatted and formatted documents. Typically, formatted documents with clear structure and metadata should provide better search accuracy because they provide more semantic meaning and context, making it easier for the search engine to retrieve relevant information. In this sub-section, we have outlined a step-by-step process for preparing and indexing documents to improve search accuracy. The focus is on comparing unformatted documents to formatted ones using Quarto Markdown, and how sitemap integration enhances search engine results.\n\n- Step 1: Document Preparation\n    - Create **unformatted text**, **PDF**, or **Markdown files**.\n    - Create **formatted documents** using **Quarto**, which include metadata, clear headings, and semantic structure.\n\n- Step 2: Sitemap Generation\n    - For the formatted documents, generate a **sitemap** in XML format.\n    - The sitemap should list all document URLs along with relevant metadata (e.g., last modified date, frequency of changes).\n\n- Step 3: Set Up Search Engine\n    - Choose a simple search engine library, such as **Whoosh**.\n    - Create a **search index** for both sets of documents (formatted and unformatted).\n    - Ensure that metadata is included in the search index for the formatted documents.\n\n- Step 4: Develop Web Crawler\n    - Write a simple **web crawler** to crawl both unformatted and formatted documents.\n    - For the formatted documents, ensure the crawler uses the **sitemap** to guide the indexing process.\n\n- Step 5: Test Search Accuracy\n    - Perform search queries for common terms in both unformatted and formatted datasets.\n    - Measure the relevance of search results using metrics like **precision**, **recall**, and **F1 score**.\n\n- Step 6: Analyze Results\n    - Compare the performance of the search engine on unformatted versus formatted documents.\n    - **Hypothesis**: Documents with structure and a sitemap will produce better search accuracy, yielding higher relevance in the results.\n\nThis Quarto Markdown setup can be used in a Jupyter notebook (ipynb) under a single section, maintaining clarity and structure in both the notebook and final rendered outputs (e.g., HTML, PDF, or DOCX).\n\n# 5. Conclusion\nThe **European Environment Agency (EEA)** recognizes the growing need for generative chatbots and natural language analysis tools to facilitate easy access to CLMS data. In response, the EEA is undertaking preparatory efforts to establish the necessary standards and infrastructure for successful chatbot integration. These activities focus on ensuring that CLMS products are **findable** and **discoverable**, enabling users, regardless of technical expertise, to access environmental data seamlessly.\n\nA key part of this strategy is making CLMS documentation and data accessible to third-party generative AI platforms. By implementing standards for formatting and exposing information—particularly through **Quarto Markdown** and **sitemaps**—CLMS ensures that high-quality, structured data is available to chatbots and AI systems. This not only enhances product discoverability but also improves user experience, allowing chatbots to guide users through complex datasets and environmental resources.\n\nThe collaboration between CLMS and the EEA lays the groundwork for a future where AI systems can efficiently retrieve and process environmental data, supporting informed decision-making and increasing public engagement with CLMS products.\n\n# 6.
