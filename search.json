    "text": "4.1 Reproducibility\nThe overarching principle of reproducibility is further unfolded below in the following sub-principles:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 1:\nDescription of workflows must be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nDeliverables which are a result of pre-processing of data must be provided with a description of the workflow for the pre-processing\n\n\nWhy:\nTo ensure that the deliverable can be re-produced, details must be provided on how this can be achieved\n\n\nConsequence:\nDescriptions of pre-processing workflow steps are to be provided with deliverables. Ideally the workflows delivered as scripts or similar. At a minimum documentation of how the workflows are to be set up is to be provided\n\n\nExample:\nA delivery that includes a web application, shall include description of the build process, such as the compilation of source code, packaging of the application, and deployment steps. This for instance could include details on the specific versions of tools used (e.g. Node.js, Docker etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 2:\nData sources to be supplied with deliverables\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nIT solutions which utilize data sources must supply the data sources\n\n\nWhy:\nTo ensure that the deliverable can be re-produced details are required on data sources used along with any enrichment which have been applied to the data source\n\n\nConsequence:\nData source location must be provided if data are publicly available. If data are not accessible to the CLMS, the data are to be provided as part of the deliverable\n\n\nExample:\nIf the software relies on a proprietary weather data API that is not publicly accessible, the data, or at least a sample dataset, should be provided with the delivery. If the API is publicly available, detailed instructions on how to access it (e.g., API keys, endpoint URLs) must be included\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 3:\nList of software used in development of IT solution to be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe software products which have been used in the development of the software are to be listed as part of the deliverable\n\n\nWhy:\nTo ensure that the IT solution can be further developed details are required of the software components/products that were used in the development\n\n\nConsequence:\nList of software development tools used in the production to be provided. Further for client specific developments the source code must also be provided\n\n\nExample:\nA system consisting of several building blocks, such as User Interface, backend, importer, and exporter modules, shall be provided with a list of software development tools, used for production of these building blocks and modules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 4:\nAutomation tool/scripts used in the production of the IT solution must be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nIT solutions which include automation scripts/workflows in the development must supply these scripts as part of the deliverable\n\n\nWhy:\nAutomation scripts used in development are viewed as part of the deliverable and are required for reproduction of the solution\n\n\nConsequence:\nAutomation scripts whether as stand-alone scripts or as a configuration of standard/commercial software must be provided as part of the deliverable\n\n\nExample:\nIf the IT deliverable includes an automatic backup that generates full backups in certain increments, then the automation scripts behind the backup generation must be provided as part of the deliverable, so that they could be recreated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 5:\nIf a solution includes outcomes of pre-executed algorithms the prerequisites for running the algorithms must be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nTo ensure reproducibility, the algorithms must be provided either as pseudo code or as source code\n\n\nWhy:\nThe foundation of the IT solution must be re-producible to ensure future enhancements are possible say if new insights/data become available also after the end of the contractual agreement\n\n\nConsequence:\nSupplier must as part of the deliverable also detail any algorithms which form the basis of the solution\n\n\nExample:\nA spatial product, providing a detailed pan-European wall to wall 10-meter spatial resolution raster product, that is based on a supervised classification of satellite image time-series. The supplier must provide a detailed description of the algorithm that was used for classifying satellite-imagery time-series"

Future work can hereby utilize and benefit from previous work. Delivered IT solutions should form part of the overall IT ecosystem of the EEA CLMS program so that the “whole is greater than the sum”\n\n\nConsequence:\nIT solutions should be provided with APIs which access key functionality of the IT solutions\n\n\nExample:\nA webservice provided, which publishes geospatial data, has an API Rest service, which grants users direct access to the data\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusability 2:\nScripts used in production must be delivered as part of IT solutions\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nScripts should be delivered with code so that they may be used as templates for the end user for further development\n\n\nWhy:\nData, conditions, or requirements may change for an IT solution. To ensure that such changes can be accommodated the underlying script must be possible to modify to reflect and support such changes\n\n\nConsequence:\nScripts used in the productions form part of the final deliverable\n\n\nExample:\nIT delivery, consisting of several building blocks, shall be provided with scripts, included with the final delivery of the code, so that the end users of the system could modify, expand, or adopt the building blocks/modules to suit specific needs or add new features\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReusability 3:\nDocumentation of IT solutions are to be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nDocumentation of the developed IT solutions must be provided.

This enables efficient future developments and modifications\n\n\nConsequence:\nSource code of client specific software must be delivered with IT solution. The source code shall include CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Development), Docker recipes and be published under the EUPL-1.2. license\n\n\nExample:\nSource code of all the components of the specific IT solution must be delivered. Any updates or developments of the source code shall be reflected in the EEA GitHub repository, which is the main repository of the system. Moreover, the specific client IT solutions shall be published under the EUPL-1.2 license, so the openness and transparency are ensured\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency 2:\nInline documentation of the source code\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nSource code of client specific IT solution must be documented in-line\n\n\nWhy:\nTo effectuate the handover from one developer to the next inline documentation are to be included to guide the developer on the job\n\n\nConsequence:\nSource code must have inline documentation. Inline code should be formatted so that it may be easily extracted to generate online documentation\n\n\nExample:\nSource code of all the components of the IT solution must have inline documentation. The documentation shall be structured, following common conventions, and kept at a minimal, but comprehensive level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency 3:\nCommercial software used in the production/development must be attainable by the EEA or a third-party provider\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nCommercial software which are prerequisites must be attainable on comparable terms. Such software is justified only if no open alternative exists\n\n\nWhy:\nTo ensure that further work may be carried out any prerequisites in the form of software must be attainable by the EEA or a supplier\n\n\nConsequence:\nGenerally attainable commercial software used in production must be listed when delivering an IT solution. Name of software, version, EOL and EOS to be supplied\n\n\nExample:\nAn IT solution is deploying various components and the set-up of the virtual machines that houses the components is done by means of an infrastructure as-a-code-tool. All the capabilities of the infrastructure as-a-code-tool, that require purchasing must be listed when delivering the IT solution"
