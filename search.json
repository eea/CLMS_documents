Ideally the workflows delivered as scripts or similar. At a minimum documentation of how the workflows are to be set up is to be provided\n\n\nExample:\nA delivery that includes a web application, shall include description of the build process, such as the compilation of source code, packaging of the application, and deployment steps. This for instance could include details on the specific versions of tools used (e.g. Node.js, Docker etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 2:\nData sources to be supplied with deliverables\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nIT solutions which utilize data sources must supply the data sources\n\n\nWhy:\nTo ensure that the deliverable can be re-produced details are required on data sources used along with any enrichment which have been applied to the data source\n\n\nConsequence:\nData source location must be provided if data are publicly available. If data are not accessible to the CLMS, the data are to be provided as part of the deliverable\n\n\nExample:\nIf the software relies on a proprietary weather data API that is not publicly accessible, the data, or at least a sample dataset, should be provided with the delivery. If the API is publicly available, detailed instructions on how to access it (e.g., API keys, endpoint URLs) must be included\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 3:\nList of software used in development of IT solution to be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe software products which have been used in the development of the software are to be listed as part of the deliverable\n\n\nWhy:\nTo ensure that the IT solution can be further developed details are required of the software components/products that were used in the development\n\n\nConsequence:\nList of software development tools used in the production to be provided. Further for client specific developments the source code must also be provided\n\n\nExample:\nA system consisting of several building blocks, such as User Interface, backend, importer, and exporter modules, shall be provided with a list of software development tools, used for production of these building blocks and modules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 4:\nAutomation tool/scripts used in the production of the IT solution must be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nIT solutions which include automation scripts/workflows in the development must supply these scripts as part of the deliverable\n\n\nWhy:\nAutomation scripts used in development are viewed as part of the deliverable and are required for reproduction of the solution\n\n\nConsequence:\nAutomation scripts whether as stand-alone scripts or as a configuration of standard/commercial software must be provided as part of the deliverable\n\n\nExample:\nIf the IT deliverable includes an automatic backup that generates full backups in certain increments, then the automation scripts behind the backup generation must be provided as part of the deliverable, so that they could be recreated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 5:\nIf a solution includes outcomes of pre-executed algorithms the prerequisites for running the algorithms must be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nTo ensure reproducibility, the algorithms must be provided either as pseudo code or as source code\n\n\nWhy:\nThe foundation of the IT solution must be re-producible to ensure future enhancements are possible say if new insights/data become available also after the end of the contractual agreement\n\n\nConsequence:\nSupplier must as part of the deliverable also detail any algorithms which form the basis of the solution\n\n\nExample:\nA spatial product, providing a detailed pan-European wall to wall 10-meter spatial resolution raster product, that is based on a supervised classification of satellite image time-series. The supplier must provide a detailed description of the algorithm that was used for classifying satellite-imagery time-series"

The source code shall include CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Development), Docker recipes and be published under the EUPL-1.2. license\n\n\nExample:\nSource code of all the components of the specific IT solution must be delivered.

Inline code should be formatted so that it may be easily extracted to generate online documentation\n\n\nExample:\nSource code of all the components of the IT solution must have inline documentation. The documentation shall be structured, following common conventions, and kept at a minimal, but comprehensive level\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nTransparency 3:\nCommercial software used in the production/development must be attainable by the EEA or a third-party provider\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nCommercial software which are prerequisites must be attainable on comparable terms.
