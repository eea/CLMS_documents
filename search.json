    "text": "1 Urban\n\nThe urban classes contain land that is covered by building structures and transport network. Urban fabrics appear in blue and darkish blue-grey on satellite images.\nThe establishment of the boundary between continuous, dense and low density urban fabric can be difficult to delimit. The main aspects to determine these classes are either by the presence and quantity of vegetation, or by the use of the IM.D HRL.\nFrom the UA Mapping Guide:\n\nSurfaces with dominant human influence but without agricultural land use. These areas include all artificial structures and their associated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces.\nArtificial structures are defined as buildings, roads, all constructions of infrastructure and other artificially sealed or paved areas.\nAssociated non-sealed and vegetated surfaces are areas functionally related to human activities, except agriculture.\nAlso, the areas where the natural surface is replaced by extraction and/or deposition or designed landscapes (such as urban parks or leisure parks) are mapped in this class.\nThe land use is dominated by permanent population.\n\nSpecific generalization/delineation rules are applied for urban classes:\n\nSegments of roads, rivers and railways &lt; 0.5 ha, that are necessary to represent the “network” of each feature will be mapped. Features &lt; 0.1 ha will be generalized.\nUrban objects confined by roads or railways ≥ 0.25 up to &lt; 0.5ha. Smaller urban objects will be generalized.\nIf an infrastructure line is crossing a river, the bridge has to be mapped if the bridge is wider than 10 meters.\nSpecific generalization rules are applied to 1.1.1.3 Low density fabric (IM.D &lt;30%) class (see description of the specific class).\n\nThis category includes:\n\n1.1 Urban fabric, industrial, commercial, public, military and private units\nUrban fabric contains land covered by artificial structures and transport networks.

In those cases urban features up to a MMU of 0.25 ha are kept and flagged with comments (“Area size exception”).\n\nMMW Exceptions:\n\nTo maintain continuity of linear features (1.2.1.0 / 1.2.2.0 / 6.2.1.0 / 6.2.2.0 / 9.1.1.0 / 9.1.2.0), the MMW may fall below the limit of 10 m over a distance of up to 100 m.\n\n\nMethodological Advice:\n\nIf local in-situ data other than UA available, use if suitable.\nIM.D HRL has to be used outside UA Core, for delineation support.\nFor interpretation of urban density: Use IM.D HRL.\n\nGeneralisation Rules:\nIf a strict MMU &gt;0.5 ha mapping of class 1.1.1.3 is applied, the low urban density areas would be underestimated. Therefore, to get a good representation of the area, the following generalisation rules will be adopted:\n\nDo not apply the 10 m MMW distance rule at the urban fringe but apply a &lt; 50m MMW to generalize outline.\nInclude private gardens.\nAvoid mapping of single urban segments.\nMap the “whole structure”.\nClose gaps at the urban fringe applying a maximum width of 50 m.\n\nIn any case, real agricultural/grassland parcel contained within urban surroundings, will be mapped as agricultural/grassland.\n\n\n\nExample of generalized delineation of a low density urban fabric area, class 1.1.1.3 (Example from Poland).

    "text": "2 Cropland\n\nCropland is the main food production area. It includes both, intensively managed ecosystems and multifunctional areas supporting many semi-natural and natural species along with food production (lower intensity management). It comprises regularly or recently cultivated agricultural, horticultural and domestic habitats and agro-ecosystems with significant coverage of natural vegetation (agricultural mosaics) (Maes et. al., 2013).\nMAES categorizes croplands in three main groups:\n\nArable Land\nPermanent Crops\nHeterogeneous agricultural areas\n\nArable Land is land under a rotation system used for annually harvested plants and fallow lands. The land is permanently or not irrigated. It includes cereals, oil seed plants, vegetables, beets, fodder and flooded crops such as rice and other inundated croplands.\nPermanent crops are surfaces that are not under a rotation system but last for many seasons and need not to be replanted after harvest. Included are ligneous crops of standard cultures for fruit production such as extensive fruit orchards, olive groves, chestnut groves, walnut groves, shrub orchards such as vineyards and some specific low-system orchard plantation, espaliers and climbers. In the case of irrigated permanent crops, the qualification of irrigation prevails over permanent, thus, all the irrigated permanent crops are classified as 2.1.1.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land.\nHeterogeneous agricultural areas comprise surfaces where several categories are mixed. This may be either annual crops associated with permanent crops on the same parcel or annual crops cultivated under forest trees. Moreover, also combinations of annual crops, meadows and/or permanent crops mixed with natural vegetation or natural areas belong to this class.\nSpecific decision rules have been stabilised to distinct different types of heterogeneous agricultural areas:\n\nAnnual crops associated or in mosaic with permanent crops (vineyards, olives groves and non-irrigated fruits trees) in parcels &lt; 0.5 has. →2.3.1.0 Annual crops associated with permanent crops.\nMosaic or association of arable land and permanent crops in parcels &lt; 0.5 has. →2.3.2.0 Complex cultivation patterns.\nMix of arable land and pastures → 2.3.2.0 Complex cultivation patterns.\nCrops (annual/permanent/irrigated/non-irrigated) and mosaic of crops and pastures in mosaic or invaded by natural vegetation (agricultural area &gt; 75% and presence of parcels) → 2.3.3.0 Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation.\nAgro-forestry landscapes in specific locations → 2.3.4.0 Agro-forestry.\n\nThis category includes:\n\n2.1 Arable land\n\n2.1.1 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land\n\n2.1.1.0 Arable irrigated and non-irrigated land\n\n\n2.1.2 Greenhouses\n\n2.1.2.0 Greenhouses\n\n\n\n2.2 Permanent crops\n\n2.2.1 Vineyards, fruit trees and berry plantations\n\n2.2.1.0 Vineyards, fruit trees and berry plantations\n\n\n2.2.2 Olive groves\n\n2.2.2.0 Olive groves\n\n\n\n2.3 Heterogeneous agricultural area\n\n2.3.1 Annual crops associated with permanent crops\n\n2.3.1.0 Annual crops associated with permanent crops\n\n\n2.3.2 Complex cultivation patterns\n\n2.3.2.0 Complex cultivation patterns\n\n\n2.3.3 Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation\n\n2.3.3.0 Land principally occupied by agriculture with significant areas of natural vegetation\n\n\n2.3.4 Agro-forestry\n\n2.3.4.0 Agro-forestry (Mediterranean Areas)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.1.0 Arable Irrigated and Non-Irrigated Land\nThis class includes the following land cover/land use types: non-irrigated arable land; irrigated arable land and rice fields; and complex patterns of irrigated and non-irrigated arable land.\n\n\nClass 2.1.1.0 Type A: Non-Irrigated Arable Land\n\n\nDefinition\nAll kind of crops like cereals, legumes, fodder crops, root crops and fallow land. Includes flower and tree (nurseries) cultivation and vegetables (e.g. asparagus), whether open field or under plastic sheets. Includes market gardening and aromatic, medicinal and culinary plants.\n\n\n\nNon-irrigated arable land: Rapeseed in Germany. Credits: M.

Most of the crops cannot be cultivated without an artificial water supply.\nUse of permanent irrigation infrastructure (irrigation channels, drainage network, irrigation ponds). This class includes also rice fields and irrigated fruits trees and vineyards in Mediterranean region. Irrigated arable land is restricted to Mediterranean areas, except clear areas with irrigated permanent infrastructures in other regions (such as Po river valley or Danube plain in Romania). The delimitation of Mediterranean will be based on biogeographic regions cartography.\nThis type includes:\n\nTraditional irrigated arable land with permanent irrigation infrastructure. Traditional irrigation areas located in fertile alluvial soils alongside the main Mediterranean rivers. These areas also include intensively or extensively managed fruit trees.\n\n\n\n\n\nIrrigation channel in Osmaniye (Turkey). Credits:“Osmaniye irrigation” by Ozgurmulazimoglu - Own work.

Full irrigation is needed to maintain these crops (e.g. orange trees, lemon trees, peach trees, etc.). Irrigated strawberries fields intensively managed. Intensively irrigated vineyards in Mediterranean region. In many cases associated to artificial irrigations ponds. Well represented in Southern Spain.

Olive-trees, other fruit trees and vineyards could be also sporadically irrigated using localization irrigation systems. These categories are not included in this class → other arable land categories.\nAncient rice fields with irrigation channels should be mapped according to their actual land cover.\n\nAttributes:\n\nN/A \n\nAppearance:\nTraditional irrigated arable land with permanent irrigation infrastructure\n\n\n\nTraditional irrigated area in Saka (Anatolia, Turkey) SPOT-5 (2.5 m.)

    "text": "3 Woodland and Forest\n\n\n\n\n\nThe woodland and forest classes are mainly dominated by woody vegetation of various ages or by succession of climax vegetation types (MAES et al. 2013). The interpretation is done according to FAO (2000) with tree cover &gt;10%, MMU of 0.5 ha and trees able to reach 5 m height in-situ at maturity. Young natural stands and all plantations established for forestry purposes, which have yet to reach a crown density of 10% or tree height of 5 m, are also included as forest. These areas normally are part of the forest area although temporarily unstocked because of human intervention or natural reasons but which are expected to revert to forest.\nForest further comprises:\n\nnurseries and seed orchards that constitute an integral part of the forest;\nforest roads;\ncleared tracts &lt; 0.5 ha;\nfirebreaks and other small open areas &lt; 0.5 ha;\nforest in national parks, nature reserves and other protected areas with an area of more than 0.5 ha and width of more than 10 m (which goes beyond the FAO Forest definition of 20 m);\nplantations primarily used for forestry purposes, including rubber wood plantations and cork oak stands.\n\nLand predominantly used for agricultural practices is excluded. Excluded is also land with:\n\neither a crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of 5-10% of trees able to reach a height of 5m at maturity in situ;\na crown cover (or equivalent stocking level) of more than 10% of trees not able to reach a height of 5m at maturity in situ (e.g. dwarf or stunted trees);\nshrub or bush cover of more than 10 percent is not accounted as Forest.\n\nThe differentiation between broadleaved, coniferous and mixed forest is in accordance with CLC interpretation guideline and HR Forest definition.\nBroadleaved forest: Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where broadleaved species predominate and represent more than 75% of the pattern.\nConiferous forest: Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where coniferous species predominate and represent more than 75% of the pattern.\nMixed forest: Vegetation formation composed principally of trees, including shrub and bush understoreys, where neither broadleaved nor coniferous species predominate.

Generally grasses (basically graminacea plants but can include tall forbs, rushes and sedges, mosses and lichens) covers more than 30% of the soils (EUNIS description), called below Crown Cover Density (C.C.D.).\nAccording to Annex I of the EU Habitats Directive, European natural grasslands are limited to alpine meadows (as Alpine, Pyrenean and Oro-Iberian grasslands) and other located grasslands.\nIn this sense, MAES level 2 natural grasslands are considered as natural and semi-natural grasslands and managed grasslands are agricultural grasslands. The main characteristics of agricultural grassland are the high human influence, basically cultivation and visible parcel structure in EO data.\nSemi-natural grasslands are frequently associated with trees and scrubs. These grasslands should be managed to maintain their grass coverage, basically by cutting out scrubs manually or mechanically. The combination of trees and grasslands is also present in many locations in Europe (in alluvial areas; in wooded hay meadows; due forest clearing, etc.). Dehesas and other wooded pastures, as Fennoscandinavian wooded pastures, are included in MAES Croplands class (agroforestry systems located in South Western Europe) or woodland and forest (in the case of forest pastures).\nThis category includes:\n\n4.1 Managed grassland\n\n4.1.0 Managed grassland\n\n4.1.0.0 Managed grassland\n\n\n\n4.2 Natural & semi natural grassland\n\n4.2.1 Semi-natural grassland\n\n4.2.1.0 Semi-natural grassland\n\n\n4.2.2 Alpine and sub-alpine natural grassland\n\n4.2.2.0 Alpine and sub-alpine natural grassland\n\n\n\n\n\n4.1.0.0 Managed Grassland\nDefinition:\nManaged grasslands are considered intensively managed areas for the production of grass. From a land use point of view, in the case of these agricultural grasslands, grass is a crop in the same way as cereals or others. Managed grasslands could be divided into improved and semi-improved grasslands according to their management.\nAgricultural grasslands occupy huge areas in the lowlands of the European plain and in United Kingdom and Ireland, where they have a longer growing season due to climatic conditions, leaving dryer areas for arable crops. In many areas, arable land and agricultural grasslands are mixed.\nThis category corresponds to 231 Corine class (Pastures). According to the statistical analysis of Corine Land Cover 2006 data, pastures (231 classes) occupied 66% of more than 60.000.000 ha considered as grasslands (classes 231-pastures- and 321 –natural grasslands-).\nThe main characteristics of an ideally improved agricultural grassland farmland are 4\n\nThe grass farmland is dominated by selected grasses, especially perennial, and the crop is very dense. In early spring, the grassland is often fertilized by the farmer. These grass farmland areas are chlorophyll rich almost all year long and do not contain or contain very little dead biomass.\nIntensive cutting and grazing is done during the grass growing season (usually from April to September).\nThe grass could be cut and preserved for winter feeding. The grass for silage must be harvested in an optimum moment.\nSome farmers spread the grass by mower to achieve a better wilt, with the objective to remove excessive moisture for silage. This process could generate rows in the land due to accumulation of grasses. In many cases, this makes grasses undistinguishable from arable land using remote sensing techniques.\nFertilizers are applied.\nAgricultural grassland could be reseeded.\nUsually there are farm buildings (silages; covered yards; stables, etc.) around.\nOften/mainly used for grazing.\nImproved grassland could be included in rotation. In many countries and in European regulations (as EC Regulation 796/2004 related to EU agricultural policy) an area is considered as “permanent grassland” if the land is covered by grasses during at least five years.\n\nPer definition, there is no tree or scrub presence in improved grasslands\nIn between the intensively used grass farmland or in specific regions (as the bocage landscape in France), there can be plots of less intensive or extensive grassland, e.g. mowed only once a year. This type of grasslands (lowland and mountain hay meadows) could be considered as semi-improved grasslands (prairie in France; prado in Spain). Like in mountain alpine meadows, the percentage of wild floral species can increase. These grasslands can content trees and scrubs, especially trees walls around the parcels.\n\n\n\nManaged (improved) grasslands in Friesland (The Netherlands). Credit: European Union, 2012.

Alonso\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic representation of managed (semi-improved) grasslands\n\n\nManaged grasslands are discriminated from arable land using Landsat and VHR images, specific color and structure patterns (arable land parcels are generally more angular in shape than pastures and the texture is smooth) and the identification of cultivation tracks, but a certain grade of confusion between two classes is expected. Arable land, in Continental; Mediterranean and Nordic environments, typically appears on flat lowland soils with clay / fine sediment and few blocks. They are therefore generally more angular in shape than pastures and the texture is smooth.\n\n\n\nManaged grassland in Scandinavia. Borders to arable land. SPOT-5 image.* (*1/2/3 Band Combination).

Here are also included marginal grasslands: abandoned crop invaded by grasses; areas near roads and other infrastructures; abandoned dumping sites, etc.\nSemi natural grasslands include both dry grasslands and mesic grasslands:\n\nDry Grasslands: The EUNIS definition of dry grassland is: “Well drained or dry lands dominated by grass or herbs, mostly not fertilized and with low productivity. Included are [Artemisia] steppes. Excluded are dry Mediterranean lands with shrubs of other genera where the shrub cover exceeds 10%; these are listed as garrigue (F6)6.”\n\n\nThe Annex I of Habitat Directive considers diverse grassland types as dry grasslands, from calcareous grasslands of central and western Europe, to steppes in Pannonic region or pseudo-steppes in Mediterranean areas. In all cases, these are grasslands located in less fertile soils, and are extensively managed (not ploughed and rarely fertilized) and used for livestock grazing. In Annex I this type of grasslands are considered as semi-natural.\nIn the Mediterranean Region, dry grasslands are considered by the Annex I of Habitat Directive as pseudo-steppes. They are characterized by their loss of greenness in summer-time and are devoted to livestock grazing. In Hungary and other countries we find steppes grasslands (known here as puszta), as part of the dry grasslands. Pannonian steppes are flat alluvial plains dominated by herbaceous plants extensively managed and strongly transformed by agriculture. Turkey is also dominated by the Eurasian steppe (Central Anatolia steppe; Easter Anatolia Montane Steppe and Ponto-Sarmatic steppes in the Black Sea region). Semi-natural dry grasslands are also present in salt steppes and in gypsum steppes across Europe. Mediterranean salt steppes (Limonietalia); Iberian gypsum vegetation (Gypsophiletalia) and Pannonic salt steppes and salt marshes are also considered as semi-natural grasslands. Nordic alvar grasslands are also included here. These grasslands are located in dry calcareous and limestone bedrocks, covered by snow in winter and subject to strong winds. Regularly clearing is necessary to avoid scrubs. Coastal grasslands as machairs (specific coastal old landscape present in dunes in western Ireland and Scotland) dominated by grasses are also included.\nIn the case of steppes (Anatolian steppe) and Mediterranean pseudo-steppes (dry Mediterranean grasslands), grasses and grass-like plants are mixed with patches of rocks and/or sparsely vegetated areas. These habitats (especially Anatolian steppes) are characterized by low biomass due to dry conditions and poor soils. In many cases these steppes suffer for over-grazing and erosion7. As results, especially during summer time, it is not feasibly the distinction using EO data between areas covered by grasses (MAES class 4. Grassland) and rocks and areas with sparsely vegetation (MAES class 6. Sparsely vegetated land). In this case has been adopted the concept of steppes and pseudo-steppes as an edaphic climax habitat dominated by grasses and grass-like plants but with a high presence of sparsely vegetated areas. In this sense, generalization rules are applied (inclusion as grassland patches of low vegetation biomass) in order to avoid an excessive mapping fragmentation.\nDry grassland in Atlantic and Continental regions are restricted to very located sites affected by poor soils conditions such as calcareous dry grasslands in Western Germany, grasslands located in chalk cliffs in Denmark, grassland located in karstic regions in the Balkans or Nordic alvars8.\n\n\n\nDry grassland with trees on the Franconian Alb (juniper heathland), Germany.

Palacios\n\n\n\nMesic Grasslands: The EUNIS definition of mesic grasslands (E2) is: “Lowland and montane mesotrophic and eutrophic pastures and hay meadows of the boreal, nemoral, warm-temperate humid and mediterranean zones. They are generally more fertile than dry grasslands (E1), and include sports fields and agriculturally improved and reseeded pastures”. In EUNIS habitat classification9, the habitats are separated according the presence of water: waterlogged (the water table at or above ground level for at least half of the year), permafrost (habitats where the soil is at a temperature of less than 0oC throughout the year) and other (always dry; mesic, moist or humid; only seasonally wet; regularly but infrequently flooded or occasionally flooded by extreme weather conditions but which are free-draining; wet but not waterlogged; permanent snow and ice.). Here we consider mesic grasslands as mesic and moist or humid grasslands. The separation between mesic grasslands and wetlands is that the latter are waterlogged or frequently flooded.\n\n\nTaken into account Annex I Habitat Directive and EUNIS classification following grasslands types are included here:\n\nSemi-natural humid meadows: wet pastures (including riverine meadows), Mediterranean alluvial meadows and Northern boreal alluvial meadows.\nMesophile grassland not included in 4.1.0.0 Managed grasslands, including abandoned hay meadows.\n\n\n\n\nSpontaneous grassland in Bieszczday district (Poland).

    "text": "7 Wetland\n\nAccording to Article 1.1 of the Ramsar Convention25 (1971), wetlands are: “areas of marsh, fen, peatland or water, whether natural or artificial, permanent or temporary, with water that is static or flowing, fresh, brackish or salt, including areas of marine water the depth of which at low tide does not exceed six meters”. This MAES class refers only to inland freshwater/saline wetlands.\nInland wetlands are predominantly water-logged specific plant and animal communities supporting water regulation and peat-related processes. This class includes natural or modified mires, bogs and fens, as well as peat extraction sites26 (MAES). Surfaces of temporary water are included in wetlands. According EUNIS guidelines (see table below), water-logged means the presence of the water table at or above ground level for at least half of the year.\nAdaptation of water interpretation in EUNIS27 and related RZ classes\n\n\n\n\n\nA decision criteria tree is established to clarify guideline distinctions between CODE Level 4 classes as follows:\n\n\n\n\n\nThis category includes:\n\n7.1 Inland wetlands\n\n7.1.1 Inland marshes\n\n7.1.1.0 Inland marshes\n\n\n7.1.2 Peat bogs\n\n7.1.2.1 Exploited peat bog\n7.1.2.2 Unexploited peat bog\n\n\n7.2 Coastal wetlands\n\n7.2.1 Salt marshes\n\n7.2.1.0 Salt marshes\n\n\n7.2.2 Salines\n\n7.2.2.0 Salines\n\n\n7.2.3 Intertidal flats\n\n7.2.3.0 Intertidal flats\n\n\n\n\n\n7.1.1.0 Inland Marshes\nDefinition:\nInland wetlands without a direct connection to the open ocean with significant content of water, which is influenced by a certain seasonal fluctuation.\nThis category corresponds to 411 CORINE Land Cover class (Inland marshes). Both inland freshwater marshes and inland salt marshes are included in this class. They are created where saline ground water rises to the surface, or in endorheic basins.\nInland marshes appear with or without a vegetation coverage. The coverage usually consists of reeds. Reed is a common name for several tall, grass-like plants of wetlands and rivers. They are all members of the order Poales: Poaceae, Cyperaceae, Sparganiaceae, Typhacea or Restionaceae.\nReed in marshes groups basically two types of plants:\n\nSedges (Cyperaceae family) are monocotyledon plants with solid and triangular stems; 3-ranked leaves; with flowers, and lenticular or triangular fruits. Sedges are common in wet habitats, including marshes, and in tundra habitats.\nRushes (Juncaceae family) are monocotyledon plants with solid and mostly round stems; few leaves, only basal or reduced to sheaths; with flowers and fruits in capsules. Rushes are common in wet habitats.\n\nIf not covered by vegetation: basically mud areas and/or waterlogged grasses and grass-like plants will be mapped.\nInland salt marshes without vegetation are located predominantly in Pannonic region (Pannonic salt steppes), Turkey, in Mediterranean specific locations and in endorheic basins across Europe.\nThis category includes:\n\nMarshes (freshwater or salt) with or without vegetation (reeds) coverage.\nAreas where reeds are harvested.\nReed covered wetland along river sides\nIn Nordic conditions: includes non-grazed/mowed and non-peat producing wetlands. These areas normally have a vegetation of tall grasses and sedges.\nAreas flooded at least six months a year with low or no vegetation.\nGrasslands highly wet or flooded at least six months a year.\nBare soils as results of previous presence of water will be also included within this category.\nIt will be taken into account that the Baltic Sea has only brackish coastal waters, which qualify for inland freshwater marshes.\nLimestone mires.\nFloating vegetation.\nReed beds in saline marshes with coverage less than 30%.\n\nThis category excludes:\n\nFloating aquatic vegetation (species such as Nuphar spp., Nymphaea spp., Potamageton spp. and Lemna spp.) is not considered as reeds and is included in 8.2. Lakes and reservoirs or 8.4 Sea and ocean.\nGrassland highly wet or flooded less than six months a year → 4.1.0.0 / 4.2.1.x Managed or semi natural grassland.\nRice fields → 2.1.1.0 Arable land.\nReeds mixed with trees (&gt; 5m) in rivers banks → 3.x.x.x Woodland and forest.\nOpen water ≥ 0.5 ha in wetland areas (class 8.2.1.0 Natural lakes).\nMesic/moist grasslands → 4.1.0.0 / 4.2.1.x Managed or semi natural grassland\nMarine wetlands such as salt marshes or salines → 7.2.x.x Coastal wetlands\nMires with more than 30% of tree cover density are considered as 3.0.0.0 Woodland and forest.\nInland exploited salines and extraction of sodium minerals in salt marshes, salt lakes or other locations → 1.3.1.0 Mineral extraction, dump and construction sites.\nShrub along river sides and on river banks (may include small patches of reeds with area &lt; 0.5 Ha) where neither climax tree-like forest formations nor grassland is detected (mainly located in areas of Mediterranean and continental climates with a summer season with warm-temperate & low precipitation) → 34.1.0 Transitional woodland and shrub.\n\nAttributes:\n\nN/A \n\n\n\n\nInland freshwater marshes in Tablas de Daimiel Natura 2000 Site (Central Spain).

Therefore the position in the terrain is used for guidance. Areas directly adjacent to bigger rivers or lakes are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes when visual interpretation is insufficient. This is because of lower chances of peat production when oxygen from flowing water is supplied to the ecosystem as opposed to ecosystems adjacent to standing water.\nNon-peat producing wetlands with a low-growing vegetation of grasses and sedges are generally grazed/mowed. These areas are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes.\nNon-grazed/mowed and non-peat producing wetlands normally have a vegetation of tall grasses and sedges and are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes. Temporarily flooded areas with low grasses and sedges are included in 4.2.1.0 Semi-natural grassland (located in mesic environments).\n\nMethodological Advice:\n\nMain identification will be based on CORINE Land Cover class 4.1.1 and Soils Map of Europe.\nThe existing knowledge on locations of large inland salines (Southern Europe, Pannonian Region or Turkey) will be taken into account and their surrounding ecosystems will be analyzed in order to detect possible occurrences of salines in class 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes.\nThe dividing line between the wetland and water classes is difficult to define without the contribution of images of different dates during the same year (in order to take into account the seasonality). The HRL Water/Wetland Layers may help to identify the boundaries between those two classes, but it should be noted that the pixel size of HR Layers is 20m and the production is based on the analysis of imagery corresponding to different years (2006-2009-2012-2018), not to different seasons.\nOther important datasets to detect these boundaries are Natura 2000 Network and Wetland Ramsar Sites databases. They are particularly relevant in the Mediterranean area and are highly recommended to use in the detection of Wetland Areas and Areas of Special Concern.\nAny available ancillary or in-situ data sources will also be used.\n\n\n7.1.2.1 Exploited Peat Bog\nDefinition:\nOpen exploited peat producing wetlands that are not greatly affected by lakes, sea water or water from water courses. Exploited peat bogs are characterized by linear trench and parcel structure.\n\n\n\nExploited peat bog in Roscommon (Ireland).

Credit imagery: Lantmäteriet\n\n\nIn low lying areas or local depressions complex mire types include areas of open peat, small ponds and streaks of mosses/heath vegetation.\nMethodological Advice:\n\nCORINE Land Cover class 4.1.2 (Peatbogs) as indication.\nNational supporting map data: vegetation map, topographical map, land cover map, Nature 2000 habitat map.\nSupporting remote sensing data: other satellite data, national aerial orthophotos (often available as WMS-service), Google earth.\nOther supporting data: HR layers, OpenStreetMap.\nComputer assisted visual interpretation of SPOT-5 data.\nIn Sweden classification is based on the Land survey Topographic map, where “wetland” and “open land” overlap. MAES wetland class is visually interpreted and adjusted manually. Adjustments of delineation are made only where obvious errors in ancillary are discernible in visual interpretation. When typical mire/peat structures cannot be seen in the image, it is difficult to determine if an area is peat producing or not. Therefore the position in the terrain is used for guidance. Areas directly adjacent to bigger rivers or lakes are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes when visual interpretation is insufficient. This is because of lower chances of peat production when oxygen from flowing water is supplied to the ecosystem as opposed to ecosystems adjacent to standing water. Grazed areas from LPIS that overlap wetland from the Topographic map are included in 7.1.0.0 Inland marshes.\n\n\n7.2.1.0 Salt Marshes\nDefinition:\nCoastal salt marshes, according to the EUNIS habitat description, are dominated by sediments and salt-tolerant stands of vegetation, occurring on the extreme upper shore of sheltered coasts and periodically covered by high tides. According to the definition of CLC class 5.2, Marine waters are oceanic and continental shelf waters, bays and narrow channels including sea lochs, fiords and straits.\nThe class salt marshes includes according to EUNIS following habitat types: salt marsh drift lines, upper salt marshes, mid-upper salt marshes and saline brackish reed, rush and sedge beds and littoral sediments not included in 7.2.3 Intertidal flats or 6.2.1 Beaches and dunes.\nThe Estuaries class (8.3.2) includes marine waters not included in class 8.4.0 Sea and ocean or other lagoons and coastal wetlands classes.\nVegetated low-lying coastal areas, above the high-tide line, susceptible to flooding by seawater. Often in the process of filling in, gradually being colonized by salt tolerant plants (saline reed beds). Salt marshes also appear without or less vegetation coverage.\nOn the date of the EO data of reference these areas may be covered or not by water. In this category, the entire marsh area will be considered as class 7.2.1, regardless if it is covered by water or not on the date of the image.\n\n\n\nSalt marshes with salt tolerant plants in Camargue (Southern France).

These lagoons are connected to the sea at limited points. Typical of Mediterranean coastal areas. In Spain called Albuferas.\n\n\nIn many cases, these coastal lagoons separated by sand barriers, are open to the sea due to sea erosion or other processes (leaky, restricted or open type lagoons). In other cases they are surrounded completely by sand banks. Many of these lagoons are man-made transformed (especially by the construction of roads on the sand barriers).\n\n\n\nSchematic view of Falsterbo coastal lagoons complex (Scania Province, Sweden)\n\n\n\n\n\nSchematic view of a transformed coastal lagoon.

Seawater enters by percolating through the bank.\n\n\n\nSchematic view of percolation Cemlyn lagoon (north Wales, United Kingdom)\n\n\nA specific case of coastal lagoons are silled or choked lagoons. These coastal lagoons are open to the sea, but the water is retained by a rock barrier (in many cases not visible in the satellite images) or by a long narrow entrance channel. Fjords are the same landform but in this case the difference from choked coastal lagoons is the water depth.\n\n\n\nSchematic view of silled lagoon of Strangford Lough (Northern Ireland, United Kingdom)\n\n\nMethodological Advice:\n\nComputer assisted visual interpretation complemented by ancillary information.\nCORINE Land cover class 521 Coastal lagoons.\nUse of Transitional Water layer (European Framework Directive) to identify general limits of coastal waters.\nUse of ancillary information:\n\nHRL Water/Wetland Layers.\nNatura 2000 database.\nWetland Ramsar Sites.\nAny available ancillary or in-situ data sources.\n\n\nDiscrimination of marshes in coastal lagoons areas:\nReed and vegetated areas in coastal lagoons areas are considered as 8.1.1.0 Salt marshes.\n\n\n\nLimnes Voulkaria Kai Saltini Natura 2000 site, Greece.

    "text": "3.9 Showing Images in Multiple Columns or Rows\nSometimes you want to display a group of images side by side or in a grid. This is useful for comparisons or visual overviews. The following approaches work well in both HTML and DOCX outputs, including when converting to PDF.\n\n\n3.9.1 Without Captions\nYou can use a Markdown table to arrange images in multiple columns and rows:\n| ![](image1.png){width=120} | ![](image2.png){width=120} | ![](image3.png){width=120} |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| ![](image4.png){width=120} | ![](image5.png){width=120} | ![](image6.png){width=120} |\nThis creates two rows with three images each. Adjust the width as needed to fit your layout.\n\n\n\n3.9.2 With Captions\nTo add captions under each image, simply include a row of text below each row of images:\n| ![](img1.png){width=120} | ![](img2.png){width=120} | ![](img3.png){width=120} |\n|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|\n| Caption 1               | Caption 2               | Caption 3               |\n| ![](img4.png){width=120} | ![](img5.png){width=120} | ![](img6.png){width=120} |\n| Caption 4               | Caption 5               | Caption 6               |\nThis method keeps captions aligned with each image, and works across all output formats.\n\n⚠️ Note: Tables used for captions will show borders in DOCX and PDF outputs. Removing them requires custom styles in a reference DOCX."

It will look almost exactly like the final PDF because it uses the same styles and layout rules.\nThis is a great option when you want to quickly check how your document will look in PDF format — especially while you’re still editing the .qmd file.\nYou don’t need to change the order of output formats in the YAML header. Just click the black arrow next to the Render button in RStudio and select “Render MS Word” from the dropdown menu.\n\nAfter rendering, the .docx file will automatically open in your default DOCX editor (e.g., Microsoft Word or LibreOffice Writer). If it doesn’t open automatically, you can still find it saved in the same folder as your .qmd file, with the same base filename.\nThis approach is fast and avoids editing the YAML just to preview layout changes."

    "text": "11.3 Output Location\nWhen you render a single .qmd file locally (e.g. using RStudio or the command line), the output (HTML or DOCX/PDF) is saved next to your source file — usually inside the src/products/ folder.\nIf you run the full command:\n$ quarto render\nthen Quarto will build the entire Technical Library and save the results in a special _site folder. However, this is typically handled automatically by the rendering workflow in the GitHub repository during the publishing process.\n\n💡 You do not need to render the entire library yourself. Just focus on rendering the file you are currently working on. This keeps things faster and easier to manage during editing.\n\n\n\n11.3.1 About the _quarto.yaml File\nThe _quarto.yaml file is a special configuration file that defines project-wide settings, including the default output folder — which is _site.\nWhen this file is present in the root of your project, RStudio (and Quarto) assumes you’re working in project mode. That means it tries to render the entire site, not just the file you’re editing.\nThis can cause a few issues during local editing:\n\nSlower preview performance\nRStudio sometimes doesn’t pick up the latest changes right away (likely due to caching)\nViewer pane might not display fresh output\n\nUnfortunately, this behavior isn’t clearly documented — but it can be confusing and frustrating.\n\n\n11.3.2 Recommended Setup for Efficient Editing\nTo avoid these issues, the repository includes a renamed config file: _quarto-not-used.yaml. This allows users to edit and preview individual files efficiently without triggering full-site rendering.\nBy default, this means:\n\nRStudio operates in “single file mode”\nOutput files (HTML, DOCX) are written directly next to the .qmd file (e.g. in src/products/)\n\n\n\n11.3.3 Rendering the Full Project\nWhen you need to preview or build the entire Technical Library locally:\n\nRename _quarto-not-used.yaml to _quarto.yaml\nRun:\n\n$ quarto render\nThis builds the full site into the _site/ folder as defined in the YAML config.\n\n⚠️ Working with _quarto.yaml in place during regular editing can work, but it may lead to slower performance or outdated previews in the Viewer pane. For a smoother editing experience, keep it renamed by default."

If data are not accessible to the CLMS, the data are to be provided as part of the deliverable\n\n\nExample:\nIf the software relies on a proprietary weather data API that is not publicly accessible, the data, or at least a sample dataset, should be provided with the delivery. If the API is publicly available, detailed instructions on how to access it (e.g., API keys, endpoint URLs) must be included\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 3:\nList of software used in development of IT solution to be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe software products which have been used in the development of the software are to be listed as part of the deliverable\n\n\nWhy:\nTo ensure that the IT solution can be further developed details are required of the software components/products that were used in the development\n\n\nConsequence:\nList of software development tools used in the production to be provided.

Also, only administrator can view and edit any ingestion and extraction within the system to support users if they need any help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT security 4:\nLogging warnings and errors\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe IT solution must log all errors, warnings and events with audit relevance from every component to a file based storage\n\n\nWhy:\nIn order to inspect system events and detect potential security incidents is crucial for maintaining the system integrity and resilience. Log information must not be revealed to the user, but must be stored internally.\n\n\nConsequence:\nAll components of an IT solution must log audit, error and warning information coming from executing the code of the solution\n\n\nExample:\nA user logs in to an application, trying to download a large dataset for processing in the application, the system encounters some fatal errors with the download. Login, user activity and technical error information and severity is logged to a persistent file storage."

    "text": "4.1 Use case: Building height and sustainability (energy use and CO2-emissions)\nStudies show that the most efficient way to impact urban form and increase the built-up density, is by increasing the building height (Eirik Resch, 2016) (Yu, et al., 2022). The urban form and built-up density can be used as an indicator of building energy use. Increased density in urban areas can result in signifcant energy savings due to less energy demand for heating and cooling (Burak Güneralp, 2017). Building more compact cities has also been identified by the IPCC as an important mitigation measure for climate change, as it is related to reduced energy use per capita, primarily because of a decrease in energy used for transportation when inhabitants are able to walk or cycle to a larger extent, but also due to reduced energy use for heating and/or cooling (Burak Güneralp, 2017) (Eirik Resch, 2016) (Jiayu Li, 2022).\nThere is a relation between built-up density, building height and building energy use, and subsequently CO2-emissions due to for example heating, cooling, ventilation, and artificial lighting. Taller buildings with compact urban form suffer less heat loss than lower buildings in colder climates and high-rise buildings in warmer climates decrease the solar exposure on surrounding buildings, in suitably dense built-up areas, which may reduce the cost of cooling.

Population change over time could be used to model migration trends. Data on built-up area and population density can also give an indication of sustainability in the form of estimated amount of waste created and environmental ability to manage it, as well as the access to and availability of resources at the local level. (D. Ehrlich, 2018)\nTo facilitate an understanding for how to build a resilient response to the impacts caused by climate change on communities, as well as how to reassess the exposure and resulting risk of people to hazards in a changing urban landscape, built-up area and population density can provide useful tools and input data.

    "text": "4.3 Use case: Informing urban planning and risks to human wellbeing\nUrbanisation and dense urban living could impact spreading of infectious diseases (Wu, 2017), building height could prove an indicator of this risk to human wellbeing, supporting plans and policies to mitigate such hazards.\nThe urban form influences the urban environment and socioeconomic activities which in turn have various effects on the urban environment in terms of for example changing land cover and urban functions and structures, which can impact for example human wellbeing. The urban form can also affect urban heat islands (UHI), greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, urban ecosystems, and public health. (Yu, et al., 2022) (Tian, 2019)\nBuilding height information in cities influence metrics such as the arise of UHI, and pedestrian ventilation and pollution dispersion. Knowledge about the building height and 3D-model of cities could prove a powerful tool to inform urban planning efforts aiming to improve human wellbeing, as well as inform studies on population distribution and CO2-emissions. (Yu, et al., 2022)\nIndoor environment can also be impacted by surrounding building height, causing acoustic and illumination effects that impact the health of building occupants, thus building height (and density) information can aid in neighborhood and building design to alleviate health problems caused by acoustic or visual discomfort. (Isabelle Y.S. Chan, 2018)\nBuilding height has been shown to affect Land Surface Temperature (LST) and air temperature (Tair) and varying building heights can contribute to better ventilation and pollution dispersion in densely built areas in cities (Bálint Papp, 2021) (Zander S. Venter, 2020). Both are indicators of urban heat and can indicate the cooling requirements of urban infrastructure, and thus the energy-use and carbon emissions (Zander S. Venter, 2020), as presented in section 4.1.\nLST is important for quantifying urban heat islands (UHI) (Zander S. Venter, 2020), and has been shown having a lower correlation (than building cover and vegetation cover and height) contributing to a higher LST in relatively low buildings (up to 9 m) and cooler climates (Alexander, 2021), but having a stronger correlation (than building density and vegetation coverage) and contributing to a lower LST in high rise buildings and warmer climates (Zhong Zheng, 2019).\nTair is largely influenced by urbanisation (Zander S. Venter, 2020) and LST (Alexander, 2021), and can be predicted with building height. Both LST and Tair can be used as an indicator for human heat exposure and UHI, but Tair may be the better indicator for this specific use and can additionally be used as a determinant of urban cooling, (Zander S. Venter, 2020). This information can be used to establish policy instruments and/or national plans to prepare for and adapt to extreme heat waves and the health risks and impact this may have on the urban population. The information on building height and the relation to Tair can also be used for climate change adaptation measures in cities, to quantify the value of eco-systems services and inform nature-based solutions.\nAir temperature, Tair, is linearly connected with varying building height, and building height is one variable to predict Tair, and can significantly reduce city ventilation and thus can indirectly affect pollution dispersion (Zander S. Venter, 2020), (Bálint Papp, 2021). High-rise buildings tend to decrease natural ventilation (Burak Güneralp, 2017). Building height can also be used as an indicator of populations density and quantification of emissions (D. Ehrlich, 2018). The temperature of block surfaces, affected by building heights and density mainly when these factors combined contribute to a decreased solar radiation reaching the block surface, also affect the temperature experienced by pedestrians, wind patterns and heat loss (Yunhao Chen, 2020).\nThese indicators and information indicate the importance of open-source building height modelling for input into urban planning for human health and wellbeing and to facilitate nature-based solutions to climate change adaptation."

The measured impact of fast-onset hazards on the built environment is largely depending on the built-up area as the main indicator of impact is measured in casualties (D. Ehrlich, 2018). The more precise the measurement of disaster impact is, the better the estimations of aid and emergency services can be.\nEmergency response to man-made, meterorological or geophysical hazards leading to unfolding disasters or humanitarian emergencies could also largely benefit from population density data. The information can aid in assessment of damage severity and number of people affected, for example with the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (Copernicus EMS) or similar services. Assessment of damage can also provide useful and updated information to resource allocation, specific and exposed assets or population groups such as transport networks and route design, utilities and industry as well as settlements.

More precise data on building density is also essential for an improved modeling and assessment of population distribution, air pollution and emissions, carbon footprint, energy demand, and traffic patterns (Thomas Esch, 2022)."

The EU-OECD have developed a methodology to define high-density clusters (also called urban centres), cities and FUAs in a consistent way across countries. Using population density and travel-to-work flows as key information, a FUA consists of a densely inhabited city and a surrounding area (commuting zone) whose labour market is highly integrated with the city (OECD 2012). For the detailed definition of urban centres, cities and FUAs please refer to “The EU-OECD definition of a functional urban area” (Dijkstra, 2019).\nThe UA BBHM product is a set of layers in GeoTIFF raster format containing building height information for 870 European cities and urban centres, located in Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) accross the EEA38 area, covering an approximate area of around 75 000 km2.\nThe UA BBHM is based on VHR imagery for the defined areas of intereste (AoI) from the reference year 2012, or as close as possible to this year, see chapter 6.2.1 for details. From these a Digital Surface Model (DSM), a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital Height Model (DHM) are created, with which the BBHM product can finally be derived.\nThe UA BBHM product has a MMU of 10 x 10 m and is projected to the European reference system EPSG:3035. All information that does not correspond to a building height value is classified as NoData, with a value in the data matrix of 65535."

An example of nomenclature for the GeoTIFF file layer is as follows: ES009_VALLADOLID_UA2012_DHM (see Table 5‑1 for more examples).\nFigure 5‑1 shows how the product is structured, as well as additional nomenclature example.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑1 Structure of the product folders\n\n\n\nTable 5‑1 Structure of the BBHM product\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nType\n\n\n\n\n\nCITY\n\nZipfile\n\n\n\nDataset\n\nFOLDER\n\n\nExample: ES009_VALLADOLID_UA2012_DHM_v010.tif\nFile\n\n\n\nMetadata\n\nFOLDER\n\n\nExample: ES009_VALLADOLID_UA2012_DHM_v010.xml\nFile\n\n\n\nPixel Based Info\n\nFOLDER\n\n\nExample: ES009_VALLADOLID_UA2012_DHM_v010.shp\nFile\n\n\n\nQC\n\nFOLDER\n\n\nExample: ES009_VALLADOLID_UA2012_DHM_v010.pdf\nFile\n\n\n\nThe following subchapters give a description of the content of each of the zipped folders.\n\n5.2.1 Previous vs. current release folder naming\nIn previous releases of the Urban Atlas products, the delineations of the FUAs have been updated continuously from one release to another, as the population densities or commuting patterns of the city areas have changed. These updated FUAs have been labelled “L”+number to indicate which version of FUA delineation was used (e.g. L1, L2, etc.). In the previous release of the UA BBHM this labelling was kept, but for this new UA BBHM release it has been removed. Thus, for a user who has downloaded UA BBHM files for any of the capital cities from the previous release, the files are named as for the example of Vienna (WIEN) in Figure 5‑2. As can be seen from the example, this was the second FUA version of Vienna, indicated by the “L2”. For this new release the downloaded folder names will not have this LX, where X indicates a number, see Figure 5‑3.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑2 Example of naming of previous releases’ .zip-file\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑3 Example of naming of current releases\n\n\nRegarding versioning there are a few aspects to take into consideration:\nIn the first release there were two versions: version “v010” (original version) and version “v020” if the city had been re-mapped due to some area extension, see Figure 5‑4. There were six cities with version “v020”. In this new release these cities will display version “v030”.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑4 Example of cities with areas extension, and the subsequent version ”v020”\n\n\nThe remaining 25 capital cities that were a part of the previous release have not been updated for building height values but were subjected to a remapping of “0” values into “NoData”, to be aligned with this new release. In this case these cities will display version “v020”.\nAll newly added cities for this release will display version “v010”.\n\n\n5.2.2 Dataset\nIn this folder, a raster file in GeoTIFF format is stored. This is a layer that shows the heights of the buildings, with a data type of 16-bit unsigned integer (UInt16) with LZW compression, since a negative height value on buildings is not expected. It presents a MMU of 10 x 10 meters, and it is projected to the European terrestrial reference system “ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA)” with EPSG:3035. All information that does not correspond to a building height value is classified as NoData, with a value in the data matrix of 65535. These characteristics allow the GeoTIFF file to occupy a very small size (as compared to the first release that also included “0” values). It was decided to remove the zeros because we could not distinguish a “0” that was a measured value or a “0” that referred to vegetation, water or roads (masked out).\nWhen the user opens the GeoTIFF file in a GIS software, it will be displayed using a default grayscale ramp, as the product does not have a default color ramp or style defined.\n\n\n5.2.3 Metadata\nA metadata file is created for each BBHM file, containing the information of the product. The information refers to data identification, classification of spatial data, geographic reference, temporal reference, quality and validity, conformity, constraints related to access and use and responsible organisation. These files were created according to the EEA metadata INSPIRE compliant requirements guideline.\n\n\n5.2.4 Pixel Based Information\nThe Pixel Based information data includes an ESRI shapefile layer, together with its associated files, showing the information and spatial distribution of the VHR satellite, or LiDAR, image pairs used for the construction of the Digital Height Model (DHM).\nEach file details the images conforming each false stereo pair. The information is subdivided into polygonal entities. When one of the polygonal entities is selected the accompanying attribute table can be shown, see example in Figure 5‑5. The attribute table shows the properties of the images that compose the image pair used to evaluate the building height in that specific area; like the image ID, the date of image acquisition, sensor used (vehicle, see Table 5‑2), percentage of cloud cover, the value of nadir angle, sun elevation, and value of azimuthal angle. These values are essential for the calculation of the DSM using optical satellite photogrammetry technology, see chapter 6.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑5 Shapefile attribute table with the main characteristics of sensor images used\n\n\nThe previous example is true for any of the 845 new cities added or capital cities remapped in this release, i.e. the 25 capital cities which were not remapped from the previous release will not have a folder called Pixel Based Info in the downloaded .zip-file. These 25 capital cities from the previous release have been included without remapping, however they have undergone a reprocessing as described in chapter 6.6.\nTable 5‑2 shows the name and description of the different sensors used.\n\nTable 5‑2 List of sensors used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensor\nDescription\nResolution\nSpectral Bands\n\n\n\n\nWV-01\nWorldview 1\n0.5\nPAN\n\n\nWV-02\nWorldview 2\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nWV-03\nWorldview 3\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nGE-01\nGeoEye 01\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nQB-02\nQuickbird 02\n0.65\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nIK\nIkonos\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 QC\nThe QC report is a report in PDF format with the results obtained after the execution of the quality control.

It is the combination of Urban Audit cities from 20181 and urban centres from 20112 (also called high-density clusters) available at GISCO3 servers.\nThe two files were merged and added to the high-density clusters of West Balkans and Turkey delineated in the framework of a previous project since West Balkans and Turkey are not part of GISCO. It represents approximately an area of 198.000km². For simplicity reasons it was decided to call it the City Perimeter described in more detail in 6.1.1.\nThis initial AoI had to be refined. The process of refining the initial AoI is described below and illustrated in Figure 6‑2.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑2 Flowchart of the AoI refinement process\n\n\n\n6.1.1 City Perimeter (City + High density clusters polygon)\nThe City Perimeter is the outer delineation of the merging of the Urban Audit cities for 2018 and “high-density clusters” (also called “urban centres”) for 2011.\nAll these files originate from different dates but were the best available at the time. The Urban Audit cities are from 2018, the High Density Custers from 2011, while the UA underlying LC/LU data is from 2012 and the satellite information are based on 2012 data, or as close as possible to 2012, see further in chapter 6.2.1.\nThis AoI was used during the searching of satellite images for the DSMs generation.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑3 Left: City administrative area (purple) and high density cluster (black line inside purple field) of Leuven. Right: City administrative area and high-density cluster merged into City Perimeter layer\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 UA Urban Areas Classes\nThe second step in refining the AoI for the BBHM product is to select the relevant LC/LU classes from Urban Atlas where buildings are expected to be found, i.e., any classes belonging to codes 1XXXX, but not for example forests or pastures or any of the classes with codes 2XXXX-5XXXX. For reference, the nomenclature of Urban Atlas LC/LU product can be found in pages 19-21 of the Nomenclature guideline4.\nThe selected classes from the Urban Atlas representing urban areas can be seen below:\n\nAirports\nDiscontinuous dense urban fabric (S.L.: 50% - 80%)\nDiscontinuous low density urban fabric (S.L.: 10% - 30%)\nDiscontinuous medium density urban fabric (S.L.: 30% - 50%)\nDiscontinuous very low density urban fabric (S.L.: &lt; 10%)\nContinuous urban fabric (S.L.: &gt; 80%)\nIsolated structures\nIndustrial, commercial, public, military and private units\nPort areas\nGreen urban areas\nRailways\nSports and leisure facilities\n\nThis AoI (UA Urban Areas Classes) is used to clip the City Perimeter AoI, to represents areas where buildings are expected within the defined City Perimeter AoI.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑4 Comparison between City Perimeter (purple) and UA Urban Areas Classes layer (red)\n\n\nA buffer of 50 m is added around the borders to avoid border errors, see Figure 6‑5.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑5 Selected UA Urban Areas classes, city of Leuven (Belgium). Left: Final result of selected classes. Right: Example of a buffer area applied to expand the original margin.\n\n\nThe result is the UA Urban Areas classes + 50 m mapped within the City Perimeter boundaries. The polygons within this shapefile are then checked for small gaps, which are filled.\nWhenever UA LC/LU classes were missing within the City Perimeter of a selected city, these missing polygons were manually created and added. In some cases, the same UA Urban Areas classes were included in two separate cities. Depending on factors like distance between the cities, FUA codes and city codes in UA, these cities have either been considered one and the same (when close together for example) or separate cities (for example when there is a big distance between them, or the cities have different city codes in the UA).\nThe previous release of the BBHM included 38 European capital cities. These areas have not been remapped in this release, except for in cases where new areas have been added to the city’s FUA (a total of 13).\nThe total number of cities mapped in this release of the BBHM is 845.\n\n\n6.1.3 UA roads, water, and wetland\nAn additional shapefile extracted from UA is created including the UA classes of: Other roads and associated land, Water or Wetlands, see Figure 6‑6. This layer is useful to eliminate pixels that do not represent buildings.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑6 Urban roads, city of Leuven (Belgium). Left: Land uses (orange), UA Urban Areas Classes. Right: Example of class selection. (red).\n\n\nThe following example shows the different AoIs applied for the city of Münster, located in the west of Germany. Figure 6‑6 shows the three types of AoIs used in the refinement process Anything in the City Perimeter AoI which does not correspond to buildings is shown in red (will be given the value NoData in the final dataset); the UA Urban Areas Classes AoI are shown in orange (numerical values in dataset if building is present), and the UA roads, water, and wetland AoI is shown in pink.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑7 Examples of the AoIs for Münster, Germany. NoData (red), UA Urban Areas Classes (orange) and Urban Road (pink)\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Building Footprints\nBuilding Footprints represent the individual constructions that were present in 2012 within the Urban Atlas. The Building Footprints layer is obtained by applying an elaborated Python algorithm to the selected high resolution satellite images, which leverages a semantic segmentation model to extract and separate individual buildings in densely compacted areas. The algorithm considers the pixel information of the multispectral and panchromatic images.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture is used for semantic segmentation of building footprints from multispectral images, and to label every pixel in the images. After each convolution layer an extra batch normalization layer will be added to avoid any extreme values, reducing sensitivity towards initial weights and reduce overfitting of the model.\nBasic morphological operation on binary data will be used for noise removal. Thereafter a Local Maxima approach will be used to separate connected buildings, by allocating local maxima and higher weight to the larger area out of building and connection. The Local Maxima is used as input source/sink in a watershed algorithm used for image segmentation. Each building obtained from this process is given a unique index for further processing. The result is a raster.\nFor areas with dense vegetation, the algorithm might generate some confusing pixels. Therefore, a review of the Building Footprints layer has been carried out for areas with dense vegetation. Hereafter a quality control is conducted to verify that no buildings or constructions were excluded, and to discard false positives.\nThe raster is then vectorized. Spatial references and coordinate systems are preserved at every step and are transferred to vector file for correct overlaying. While converting from raster to vector, the output has a lot of vertices and noises. The vector is then simplified using Douglas-Peucker algorithm (David Douglas, 1973) to help preserve the overall geometry of the shape while simplifying number of vertices. Basic attributes like area, perimeter and elevation of the buildings were automatically added. Finally, minimum bounding box was used and saved.\nThe resulting Building Footprints was later used in the BBHM production as a mask to separate areas with height data values from areas with no height data values, see chapter 6.6. If there is building footprints data available in the area, this will be considered for refining the AoI of each city.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑8 Building footprints for the city of Leuven (Belgium)"

    "text": "6.2 Data pre-processing\nThe main input data is comprised of VHR satellite images from 2012, on which the different algorithms for producing the DSM and DTM will be executed, see chapter 6.3 and 6.4. The different sensors used for the VHR image collection are, as shown in Table 5‑2, Worldview 1, 2, 3, Quickbird, Ikonos and Geoeye. The aim is to acquire stereoscopic pair images, overlapping imagery acquired from different locations, to produce a 3D model for the refined AoIs.\nThe worldwide coverage of stereoscopic pair images is very limited, as it is not the most common and easy data to capture. Satellite data might therefore, despite the vast number of images, not be sufficient to create stereo pair images of all the refined AoIs in the mapped FUAs. Instead, false stereo pair images can be used. False stereo pair images make use of two images taken from different angles, and/or not on the same date or in a simultaneous capture. The images that form the false stereo pair should however be taken as close as possible to each other in time to improve the correlation between them, which increases precision. This approach guarantees coverage of all the refined AoIs with images from different dates. To create false stereo pairs the VHR satellite images from MAXAR products are supported with Copernicus satellite images through Copernicus Reference Access Data (CORDA), and as a further option LiDAR information.\nIn cases where no satellite image close to year 2012 is available, and also no images from CORDA, the search date range is expanded, primarily around 2012 (Q4 for 2011 or Q1 for 2013) and secondarily for later years (2014 onwards) as later years have more available satellites (WV3 etc.) from which data imagery can be gathered.\nThe process of selecting suitable VHR, CORDA and LiDAR imagery was based on the following key factors:\n\nImagery availability from the MAXAR Catalogue, CORDA\nDate of capture, see detailed description in chapter 6.2.1\nOff-Nadir Angle and Cloud Cover, see detailed description in chapter 6.2.2\n\n\n6.2.1 Date of capture\nThe following are the relevant scenarios for fulfilling the “Date of capture”-criteria for the selection of VHR and LiDAR images:\n\nScenario 1: The best option for selection of images is the use of LiDAR information from dates as close as possible to 2012, when available. This scenario shows better results since there is more density and precision.\nScenario 2: The second best option is images from 2012 taken in the same month and in the same day. Part of the area has been reviewed and is covered with images from 2012. Where images are not available, LiDAR information from 2012, or on a date as close as possible to 2012, will be prioritized for generating the BBHM.\nScenario 3: The third best option is to use images from 2012 captured in the same month but on different days.\nScenario 4: The fourth best option is using images from second half of 2011 or first half of 2013 in the same month and in the same day.\nScenario 5: The fifth best option is images from 2012 with a difference in date of capture of approximately 1 month.\nScenario 6: Scenario 2 but in the first part of 2011 or in the second part of 2013\nScenario 7 (extra): Images from 2014, 2015 and 2016… until today of similar dates (i.e. captured on the same day or week). It has been shown that images of the same season and similar date give good results for obtaining elevation models even though the dates differ by one year. The only thing that would affect this scenario is in terms of large changes in apples that were not in one of the years being analyzed. In this scenario, an analysis of change between the two dates will be made. Thanks to the refinement of the AoI the commission and omission error will be minimized because the Refined AoI is focused on the Urban Areas.\n\nThe images are selected and downloaded from the MAXAR library and organized in pairs of images for each city. The images are separated by CAT IDs, which is a unique code for each image. Images were then quality controlled for errors, reviewed and validated for use, as well as merged to ease the further processing of the images. This phase generates as a result a list of selected images to be used in the next analysis, where the algorithms for creating the DSM and DTM are applied.\n\n\n6.2.2 Off-Nadir Angle and Cloud Cover\nThe most suitable satellite images were selected, in the case of Off-Nadir angle, based on base-to-height ratio, Convergence, BIE and Asymmetry Angle. If these values, when estimated, are not in the correct range, the DSMs are not correctly built.\n\n6.2.2.1 Off-Nadir Angle\nThe best is to have images with an Off-Nadir angle of 20 degrees. Pairs formed with images that have less than 5 degrees or more than 45 degrees Off-Nadir angle give bad results, and are discarded. As far as possible, images with Off-Nadir angles of more than 40 degrees have been avoided. From these criteria two scenarios are made:\n\nScenario 1: Pair of satellite images with Off-Nadir angles of between 10 and 20 degrees\nScenario 2: Satellite images with Off-Nadir angles of between 5 and 30 degrees, preferably between 5 and 20 degrees\n\nFor urban areas, large angles of convergence would lead to ground occlusions, as well as a loss of similarity between the two images that form the “stereo pair” and, consequently, a worsening of the process of searching for homologous points by automatic correlation (matching). For these reasons, small Base/Height (B/H) ratios are preferred in urban areas (Eckert and Hollands, 2010). Using an algorithm that considers the maximum and minimum incidence angle, the time difference of the images, the angle between the two images and the region of interest, a Pearson’s correlation matrix and a B/H coefficient as a function of the orbital geometric parameters of the image, as well as temporal parameters are obtained, thanks to which it is possible to find which “false stereo pair” image is the most suitable to use in the generation of the DSM, see chapter 6.3.\n\nThe selected false stereo pair images have an angle difference of 20 degrees and none of them beyond 35 degrees.\n\n\n6.2.2.2 Cloud cover\nThe aim is to generate cloud-free results, for this reason all scenes were selected, regardless of cloud cover. This approach maximized the results, facilitating the selection of the best scenarios. In case some scattered cloudiness was found in an image, a proprietary cloud masking algorithm based on multilayer neural networks was applied. If clouds covered buildings in an image, this image was discarded. In case some scattered cloudiness could be found, a proprietary cloud masking algorithm based on multilayer neural networks was applied."

The method for generating the DSM is based on taking elevations from the terrain using the false stereo pair satellite images, and by choosing the most suitable false stereo pair images. The images chosen are panchromatic with high spatial resolution of 30, 40 or 50 cm, and RPC information.\nThereafter a stereo correspondence between the two chosen images that make up each false stereo image pair is conducted, using a patented-modified version of the Semi-Global Matching (SGM) algorithm. The algorithm is based on global energy minimization that comprises a cost of equalization in pixels and smoothness terms in disparity mapping. The algorithm then applies a 3-kernel median filter to fill in small holes in null match points in the disparity map. By implementing a version of the classic RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) based on reverse methodology, outliers are eliminated.\nLastly, a 3D point cloud is obtained by triangulating the stereo correspondences between the two panchromatic VHR images, taking into consideration the rational polynomial coefficients (RPC) camera model provided for each image. The RCPs will allow triangulating the position of a 3D point identified on an image pair. This elaboration of the Digital Surface Models (DSM) is carried out using an AI-EOSURFACE algorithm on Python and C++ (and compatible with C heads) based on the epipolar geometry of a given pair of satellite images, see Figure 6‑9.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑9 Schematic representation of the epipolar geometry for a given pair of satellite images, on which the AI-EOSURFACE algorithm is based to obtain elevations\n\n\nThis algorithm has been developed for the DSM generation based on the bidimensional couple of points of a pair for the later three-dimensional densification. The dataset includes images from different platforms, all of them with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m. The DSM generation only requires the panchromatic band, however RGB and NIR bands were included as these are required for other processes of the BBHM creation.\nThe independently calculated 3D point cloud is then projected, aligned and homogenized, and the DSM is generated with a spatial resolution of 50 cm, and all DSMs are transformed to an orthometric height because to transform height data into meters of above sea level."

    "text": "6.4 Generating the DTM\nDigital terrain models (DTMs) represent the height of the bare earth’s surface. In this case, the DTMs are generated from the DSM. Non-ground features such as buildings, trees, bushes and vehicles have to be identified, and their height measurements removed from the data before interpolation. Once the DSM has been generated, it is filtered using a building emptying algorithm and removing objects that are not bare ground. Thereafter a pixel level prediction and clustering approach is used on a high-resolution multispectral image to detect the bare terrain.\nThe DTM is carried out using an AI-EOTERRAIN algorithm on Python to process each row of the given DSM separately in all directions in a window with a given extent, considering the minimum value of each row as the position of the ground. Therefore, if the pixel being evaluated has a large difference with the minimum value, the pixel is considered as not corresponding to ground, as well as when the slope between the evaluated pixel and the next one is positive and above a predefined threshold. If the slope is positive but less than the threshold, the evaluated pixel gets the same label as the pixel evaluated in the previous iteration. If the slope is less or equal, the distance to the nearest ground point is used to decide whether the evaluated pixel is classified as ground or not.\nThe building extraction process was successful with most buildings, however, in buildings that occupy a large area, the algorithm interprets the innermost areas of the roofs as ground values, due to the homogeneity of the slopes. To ensure that all values of the emptied DSM correspond to ground values, a second filtering is done using the buildings footprints layers, see chapter 6.1.4.\nDSM algorithm | Building footprints | DSM filtered\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑10 DSM filtering to remove large buildings and obtain the DTM\n\n\nThereafter the remaining bare ground is filtered by a cut off range for objects to remain in the DTM. This is based on the gradient difference, the size of the object to be removed and the terrain type, this can be either flat or hilly. A “bump and pit”-filter is applied to smoothe the DTM by removing small pits and bumps in the landscape; a median filter which is part of the final smoothing of the DTM; and finally the clamp filter, which stabilizes portions of the elevation model by raising and lowering pixels within a defined threshold.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑11 Left: DSM for an area in London.

    "text": "6.6 Generating the BBHM\nOnce the DHM of the city is available, it is necessary to extract only the height values that correspond to buildings. To do this, first all the buildings are detected from the available multispectral VHR images, using machine learning techniques. Then a building footprint extraction operation is performed, obtaining a GeoTIFF raster layer with the height values of the buildings, and with a NoData value for all those elements which are not buildings.\nTo extract the values that correspond to buildings, the vector files of the building footprints and the DHM files are required as input.\nSince the building footprints layer are in vector format with complex geometries, these are transformed into Boolean raster format, where the pixels with zero values represent the areas that do not include buildings.\nOnce the DHM file and its associated building footprints file are both available in raster format and with the same extension, a multiplication is performed, resulting in a DHM with height values only in the areas occupied by buildings. Finally, all pixels with zero in height value, i.e. the height assigned to all elements other than buildings, are reclassified to a NoData value, as otherwise they could have a negative influence on subsequent processes. This is an important difference to note between the 2006 and 2012 edition of the BBHM. It was introduced in this release since in the previous release it was not possible to distinguish between satellite measured zero values, and zero values assigned because of the type of area. Instead, in this release, all areas not representing buildings have a NoData value.\nFinally, the DHM has undergone resampling through a number of filters; reprojection to EPSG3035 coordinate system, removal of pixels outside of the City Perimeter AoI, removal of pixels outside of the UA Urban Areas AoI, removal of pixels within the Urban roads AoI and finally resampling from a resolution of 0.5m to a resolution of 10 m using a majority filter.\nThis point explains why it is necessary to translate the 0 height data values of the input DHM to NoData, since otherwise the majority of values in a pixel corresponding to a building could be equal to 0 due to the influence of the surrounding street.\nIt is also important to point out the role played by vegetation in this process, since, as the DSM is derived from stereoscopic images; it is possible that trees near buildings influence the final value of certain pixels.\nAlso, a reclassification of all pixels with a value lower than 3 m is performed, since it is assumed that no buildings are lower than 3 m.\nFinally, a final conversion of the DHM files is executed to adapt them to the requirements set according to CLMS Tools needs.\n\nEPSG:3035 coordinate reference system\nGeoTIFF data type UInt16.\nNo data value equal to 65535.\nCompression type LZW\nPixel size 10 m\nBLOCKSIZE 256x256 Specification\nTILED = YES\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑13 From a general DHM (left) to a BBHM (right) in Münster, Germany\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑14 Final BBHM at 10x10 meter resolution for Münster, Germany\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑15 General overview of building height values on Milano and zoom to the city center"

    "section": "6.7 Characteristics and limitations of the product",
    "text": "6.7 Characteristics and limitations of the product\nThis chapter describes the properties of the product and some methodological aspects that are important to understand the characteristics and limitations of the product.\nIt is important to note that because the DSMs are derived from LiDAR and VHR satellite information, the initially generated DHMs have a spatial resolution of between 0.5 and 2 meters. For the final product to comply with EEA technical requirements (spatial resolution of 10 meters), a resampling operation was performed to transform the DHM pixels from 0.5-2 m to 10 m.\nFor this transformation to be consistent with the first height values obtained, it was agreed to use a majority algorithm, i.e. the calculation will determine the most common value shown by the 0.5 - 2 m pixels contained within a new 10 m pixel, which will be assigned the most repeated value after the execution of this analysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑16 Methodological explanation about how the majority filter works when resampling\n\n\nIt is this simple resampling operation that poses the main limitations of the BBHM Urban Atlas product, which are further detailed below.\n\nNo height values in buildings that are smaller that the minimum mapping size\n\nDue to the spatial resolution of the pixel, there will be a NoData value in buildings smaller than 100 m2, such as single-family houses, buildings for public use etc., see example in Figure 6‑17.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑17 Small houses that have not been captured in the BBHM due to the minimum mapping size\n\n\n\nIssues on building edges\n\nThe influence of height values of elements or artifacts adjacent to the buildings can induce abnormally high or low values in the pixels of the edges of the buildings. In case of influence of the ground abnormally low values would be presented, or abnormally high values if it is a tree or other vertical element that interferes.\nThis happens, in addition to the majority algorithm, when extracting the height values within the building footprints. This is because it is very unusual that the outline of the building represented in the DHM coincides exactly with its building footprint, which causes the edge pixels to be retained in the DHM prior to the resampling process and, therefore, may interfere with the final result.\nThe example in Figure 6‑18 shows the height values obtained for a random building, in this case obtained by means of LIDAR technology, with a spatial resolution of 2 m.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑18 Satellite imagery (left) and DSM at half meter resolution (right)\n\n\nFigure 6‑19 shows how some pixels, with ground elevation information, are represented in red tones after extraction of the DHM values in relation to the building footprints.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑19 Difference between DSM at half meter resolution and final BBHM (right)\n\n\nWhen the resampling operation is performed and the final result is obtained, this ground elevation information is transferred to the pixels that make up the building boundary, causing the aforementioned alterations in the value of these pixels.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑20 Overview of building edges in the BBHM\n\n\nWithout a detailed case-by-case study it is not possible to conclude wheter these height deviations are caused by elements of the building itself or by influences from the ground or other artifacts. Thus, these pixels have not been corrected beyond those clearly identified during QC, which is the main limitation of the project.\nThe influence of edge elements becomes more noticeable in cities whose DHM values have been calculated from a DSM derived from VHR satellite imagery. This is because optical satellite photogrammetry technology does not reach the same levels of accuracy as achieved by LIDAR, and its results depend heavily on the acquisition properties of the images. Especially important are the angles and the correlation calculated between the two images, giving the results a more continuous and smooth appearance, i.e. there is no perfect detection of abrupt elevation changes intrinsic to the height difference between a building and the ground.\nThis behavior is especially noticeable in cities with a high density of buildings, close together, separated by narrow streets, typical in urban centers of historic cities. This combined with the resampling algorithm can result in areas with apparently great variability of building heights. This phenomenon can be observed in Figure 6‑21.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑21 Higher heterogeneity in BBHM dataset (right) than in a half meter resolution BBHM (bottom left)\n\n\n\nRoof artifacts\n\nAnother limitation of the product lies in the poor response to the LIDAR pulses of some roofs, especially noticeable in the metal cladding that covers some industrial buildings. These errors do not occur when using satellite photogrammetry and thus do not pose an issue in most of the processed cities. To correct the errors, the erroneous pixels are manually reclassified with the correct elevation value.\n\nLimitation of building footprints detection in scattered areas\n\nThe building footprints identification algorithm based on Machine Learning techniques has certain limitations when detecting isolated buildings, especially in rural environments, since the algorithm considers certain properties of coherence and spatial context for the identification of buildings. In the same way, the algorithm may present commission errors, which have been eliminated whenever they have been detected during QC.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑22 Limitations on building footprint detection especially; comission and omission\n\n\n\nUrban Areas with no values outside the AoI\n\nAs stated previously in the document, building height values are only gathered inside the AoI (see definition in chapter 6.1). In some cases, it is not possible to produce building height data for the entire delineation of the AoI, i.e. when part of the defined high-density cluster delineation falls outside the area that has been mapped by Urban Atlas. For example, the AoI for Malinas is a high-density cluster but is not mapped by Urban Atlas and does not have a FUA (no Urban Classes). Thus, it is key to consider that in these cases some urban areas in the city surroundings are not captured, so there is no height value.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑23 General view of Malinas, capturing industrial areas with no height values outside the AoI\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of DSM generation\n\nDSM generation from false pair stereo of satellite images is always challenging, since it depends on several variables: off-nadir angle, difference in days between images, cloud cover, etc. These values vary from city to city, but in general terms these have been the main issues:\n\nDSM orthorectification\nBuilding shadows\nSmall houses’ height\nOutlier removal\nWater-topography influence\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑24 Examples of the limitations of the DSM production\n\n\n\nLimitations on DTM generation\n\nWhen generating a DTM from DSM, the reliability on the accuracy of the DSM falls, e.g. a DSM derived from a high-density point cloud by using LiDAR information is more reliable than one built from satellite imagery. Also, an automatic algorithm pursues a constant accuracy across different realities, setting parameters to fix values that better capture all. However, larger buildings (e.g. industrial buildings) may not be removed completely, so a manual editing has been carried out in all the cities.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑25 Example of DTM refinement"
