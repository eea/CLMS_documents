These sub-principles addresses best-practices and industry standard design patterns.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture 1:\nClient specific IT solutions should have a modular structure\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nModular structure of client specific IT solutions is a requirement. This may be achieved using e.g. microservice architecture\n\n\nWhy:\nA modular structure is sought to ensure further development, and updates are possible. The possibility of substituting or adding modules in an IT solution will increase the lifespan of a solution and increase scalability\n\n\nConsequence:\nModular architecture of IT solutions is a requisite\n\n\nExample:\nIf the client specific IT solution has, for Example, grown its user base since the launch of the solution, then scaling up shall be possible at any time – scaling containers, vertically (more CPUs, RAM) and horizontally (more VMs)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture 2:\nIT solutions are to be Dockerized or similar\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe use of container technology is encouraged\n\n\nWhy:\nContainerization is crucial for building scalable IT solutions and container technology eases the work of moving IT solutions around the IT infrastructure making deployment easier to automate\n\n\nConsequence:\nIT solutions are to be deployed using Docker containers or similar\n\n\nExample:\nSoftware components of the client specific IT solution shall be provided as docker containers so that deployment is flexible with respect to hardware\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture 3:\nClient specific IT solutions must be able to interface with other IT solutions\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe IT deliverable must be able to be used in conjunction with other deliverables to form a composite solution\n\n\nWhy:\nTo make the most of the funds available the developed solutions should form part of an IT ecosystem making up a whole\n\n\nConsequence:\nIT deliverables must be equipped with documented APIs for interfacing with other IT applications\n\n\nExample:\nA client specific product, which can be used for extracting and manipulating data, should be accessible programmatically through e.g. well documented REST services\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nArchitecture 4:\nIT solutions should be cloud agnostic\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nIf the IT solution is built for cloud environments, measures must be taken to make the solution cloud agnostic.\n\n\nWhy:\nVendor lock-in must be avoided to remove vendor specific dependencies, making the IT solution easier to migrate to a different cloud vendor\n\n\nConsequence:\nIT solutions must minimize the usage of vendor specific functionality and non-standardized infrastructure\n\n\nExample:\nAn IT solution that makes use of serverless functions should be built in a way that allows for using another vendors serverless functionality with little or no changes in case of migrating from one platform to another"

Ideally the workflows delivered as scripts or similar. At a minimum documentation of how the workflows are to be set up is to be provided\n\n\nExample:\nA delivery that includes a web application, shall include description of the build process, such as the compilation of source code, packaging of the application, and deployment steps. This for instance could include details on the specific versions of tools used (e.g. Node.js, Docker etc.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 2:\nData sources to be supplied with deliverables\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nIT solutions which utilize data sources must supply the data sources\n\n\nWhy:\nTo ensure that the deliverable can be re-produced details are required on data sources used along with any enrichment which have been applied to the data source\n\n\nConsequence:\nData source location must be provided if data are publicly available. If data are not accessible to the CLMS, the data are to be provided as part of the deliverable\n\n\nExample:\nIf the software relies on a proprietary weather data API that is not publicly accessible, the data, or at least a sample dataset, should be provided with the delivery. If the API is publicly available, detailed instructions on how to access it (e.g., API keys, endpoint URLs) must be included\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 3:\nList of software used in development of IT solution to be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe software products which have been used in the development of the software are to be listed as part of the deliverable\n\n\nWhy:\nTo ensure that the IT solution can be further developed details are required of the software components/products that were used in the development\n\n\nConsequence:\nList of software development tools used in the production to be provided. Further for client specific developments the source code must also be provided\n\n\nExample:\nA system consisting of several building blocks, such as User Interface, backend, importer, and exporter modules, shall be provided with a list of software development tools, used for production of these building blocks and modules\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 4:\nAutomation tool/scripts used in the production of the IT solution must be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nIT solutions which include automation scripts/workflows in the development must supply these scripts as part of the deliverable\n\n\nWhy:\nAutomation scripts used in development are viewed as part of the deliverable and are required for reproduction of the solution\n\n\nConsequence:\nAutomation scripts whether as stand-alone scripts or as a configuration of standard/commercial software must be provided as part of the deliverable\n\n\nExample:\nIf the IT deliverable includes an automatic backup that generates full backups in certain increments, then the automation scripts behind the backup generation must be provided as part of the deliverable, so that they could be recreated\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nReproducibility 5:\nIf a solution includes outcomes of pre-executed algorithms the prerequisites for running the algorithms must be provided\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nTo ensure reproducibility, the algorithms must be provided either as pseudo code or as source code\n\n\nWhy:\nThe foundation of the IT solution must be re-producible to ensure future enhancements are possible say if new insights/data become available also after the end of the contractual agreement\n\n\nConsequence:\nSupplier must as part of the deliverable also detail any algorithms which form the basis of the solution\n\n\nExample:\nA spatial product, providing a detailed pan-European wall to wall 10-meter spatial resolution raster product, that is based on a supervised classification of satellite image time-series. The supplier must provide a detailed description of the algorithm that was used for classifying satellite-imagery time-series"

The following sub-principals are to be followed:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT security 1:\nIncorporate security considerations from the beginning of the system development\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nEnsure security is integrated into all stages of the system development lifecycle, from planning to deployment\n\n\nWhy:\nEarly integration of security measures reduces vulnerabilities, lowers costs associated with late-stage fixes, and ensures robust protection against threats\n\n\nConsequence:\nThreat modelling and security assessments need to be conducted from the start, as well as allocation of resources for ongoing security reviews and testing\n\n\nExample:\nStandard aspects such as two factor authentication, protection against SQL injection, encryption of sensitive data, no root users in containers, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT security 2:\nCompliance with relevant laws, regulations and industry standards\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nIT-solutions must adhere to legal requirements, industry standards, and regulations e.g. EUDPR, ISO\n\n\nWhy:\nCompliance ensures legal and regulatory adherence, builds trust, protects sensitive data, and mitigates risk of legal penalties and breaches\n\n\nConsequence:\nIT deliverables need to incorporate robust security measures, include documentation of compliance efforts, and ensure features and processes aligned with legal and industry measures\n\n\nExample:\nData handling agreements must be in place, consideration of server location in EU, etc.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT security 3:\nEnsuring that users and systems have appropriate permissions based on their roles and responsibilities\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nImplement role-based access control (RBAC) to manage user and system permissions according to their roles\n\n\nWhy:\nIt prevents unauthorized access, minimizes the risk of data breaches, and ensures that users only have access to the information necessary for their roles\n\n\nConsequence:\nThe provider will need to define clear roles and responsibilities, implement RBAC policies, regularly review and update access controls\n\n\nExample:\nA delivered IT solution has role-based accesses, which ensures that only Admin-Users are allowed to manage (add, edit, activate, inactivate) users and organisations. Also, only administrator can view and edit any ingestion and extraction within the system to support users if they need any help\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIT security 4:\nLogging warnings and errors\n\n\n\n\nWhat:\nThe IT solution must log all errors, warnings and events with audit relevance from every component to a file based storage\n\n\nWhy:\nIn order to inspect system events and detect potential security incidents is crucial for maintaining the system integrity and resilience. Log information must not be revealed to the user, but must be stored internally.\n\n\nConsequence:\nAll components of an IT solution must log audit, error and warning information coming from executing the code of the solution\n\n\nExample:\nA user logs in to an application, trying to download a large dataset for processing in the application, the system encounters some fatal errors with the download. Login, user activity and technical error information and severity is logged to a persistent file storage."

The following approaches work well in both HTML and DOCX outputs, including when converting to PDF.\n\n\n3.9.1 Without Captions\nYou can use a Markdown table to arrange images in multiple columns and rows:\n| ![](image1.png){width=120} | ![](image2.png){width=120} | ![](image3.png){width=120} |\n|----------------------------|----------------------------|----------------------------|\n| ![](image4.png){width=120} | ![](image5.png){width=120} | ![](image6.png){width=120} |\nThis creates two rows with three images each. Adjust the width as needed to fit your layout.\n\n\n\n3.9.2 With Captions\nTo add captions under each image, simply include a row of text below each row of images:\n| ![](img1.png){width=120} | ![](img2.png){width=120} | ![](img3.png){width=120} |\n|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|:------------------------:|\n| Caption 1               | Caption 2               | Caption 3               |\n| ![](img4.png){width=120} | ![](img5.png){width=120} | ![](img6.png){width=120} |\n| Caption 4               | Caption 5               | Caption 6               |\nThis method keeps captions aligned with each image, and works across all output formats.\n\n⚠️ Note: Tables used for captions will show borders in DOCX and PDF outputs.

The urban form and built-up density can be used as an indicator of building energy use. Increased density in urban areas can result in signifcant energy savings due to less energy demand for heating and cooling (Burak Güneralp, 2017). Building more compact cities has also been identified by the IPCC as an important mitigation measure for climate change, as it is related to reduced energy use per capita, primarily because of a decrease in energy used for transportation when inhabitants are able to walk or cycle to a larger extent, but also due to reduced energy use for heating and/or cooling (Burak Güneralp, 2017) (Eirik Resch, 2016) (Jiayu Li, 2022).\nThere is a relation between built-up density, building height and building energy use, and subsequently CO2-emissions due to for example heating, cooling, ventilation, and artificial lighting. Taller buildings with compact urban form suffer less heat loss than lower buildings in colder climates and high-rise buildings in warmer climates decrease the solar exposure on surrounding buildings, in suitably dense built-up areas, which may reduce the cost of cooling.

The urban form can also affect urban heat islands (UHI), greenhouse gas emissions, energy consumption, urban ecosystems, and public health. (Yu, et al., 2022) (Tian, 2019)\nBuilding height information in cities influence metrics such as the arise of UHI, and pedestrian ventilation and pollution dispersion. Knowledge about the building height and 3D-model of cities could prove a powerful tool to inform urban planning efforts aiming to improve human wellbeing, as well as inform studies on population distribution and CO2-emissions. (Yu, et al., 2022)\nIndoor environment can also be impacted by surrounding building height, causing acoustic and illumination effects that impact the health of building occupants, thus building height (and density) information can aid in neighborhood and building design to alleviate health problems caused by acoustic or visual discomfort. (Isabelle Y.S. Chan, 2018)\nBuilding height has been shown to affect Land Surface Temperature (LST) and air temperature (Tair) and varying building heights can contribute to better ventilation and pollution dispersion in densely built areas in cities (Bálint Papp, 2021) (Zander S. Venter, 2020). Both are indicators of urban heat and can indicate the cooling requirements of urban infrastructure, and thus the energy-use and carbon emissions (Zander S. Venter, 2020), as presented in section 4.1.\nLST is important for quantifying urban heat islands (UHI) (Zander S. Venter, 2020), and has been shown having a lower correlation (than building cover and vegetation cover and height) contributing to a higher LST in relatively low buildings (up to 9 m) and cooler climates (Alexander, 2021), but having a stronger correlation (than building density and vegetation coverage) and contributing to a lower LST in high rise buildings and warmer climates (Zhong Zheng, 2019).\nTair is largely influenced by urbanisation (Zander S. Venter, 2020) and LST (Alexander, 2021), and can be predicted with building height. Both LST and Tair can be used as an indicator for human heat exposure and UHI, but Tair may be the better indicator for this specific use and can additionally be used as a determinant of urban cooling, (Zander S. Venter, 2020). This information can be used to establish policy instruments and/or national plans to prepare for and adapt to extreme heat waves and the health risks and impact this may have on the urban population. The information on building height and the relation to Tair can also be used for climate change adaptation measures in cities, to quantify the value of eco-systems services and inform nature-based solutions.\nAir temperature, Tair, is linearly connected with varying building height, and building height is one variable to predict Tair, and can significantly reduce city ventilation and thus can indirectly affect pollution dispersion (Zander S. Venter, 2020), (Bálint Papp, 2021). High-rise buildings tend to decrease natural ventilation (Burak Güneralp, 2017). Building height can also be used as an indicator of populations density and quantification of emissions (D. Ehrlich, 2018). The temperature of block surfaces, affected by building heights and density mainly when these factors combined contribute to a decreased solar radiation reaching the block surface, also affect the temperature experienced by pedestrians, wind patterns and heat loss (Yunhao Chen, 2020).\nThese indicators and information indicate the importance of open-source building height modelling for input into urban planning for human health and wellbeing and to facilitate nature-based solutions to climate change adaptation."

The more precise the measurement of disaster impact is, the better the estimations of aid and emergency services can be.\nEmergency response to man-made, meterorological or geophysical hazards leading to unfolding disasters or humanitarian emergencies could also largely benefit from population density data. The information can aid in assessment of damage severity and number of people affected, for example with the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (Copernicus EMS) or similar services. Assessment of damage can also provide useful and updated information to resource allocation, specific and exposed assets or population groups such as transport networks and route design, utilities and industry as well as settlements.

For the detailed definition of urban centres, cities and FUAs please refer to “The EU-OECD definition of a functional urban area” (Dijkstra, 2019).\nThe UA BBHM product is a set of layers in GeoTIFF raster format containing building height information for 870 European cities and urban centres, located in Functional Urban Areas (FUAs) accross the EEA38 area, covering an approximate area of around 75 000 km2.\nThe UA BBHM is based on VHR imagery for the defined areas of intereste (AoI) from the reference year 2012, or as close as possible to this year, see chapter 6.2.1 for details. From these a Digital Surface Model (DSM), a Digital Terrain Model (DTM) and Digital Height Model (DHM) are created, with which the BBHM product can finally be derived.\nThe UA BBHM product has a MMU of 10 x 10 m and is projected to the European reference system EPSG:3035. All information that does not correspond to a building height value is classified as NoData, with a value in the data matrix of 65535."

These updated FUAs have been labelled “L”+number to indicate which version of FUA delineation was used (e.g. L1, L2, etc.). In the previous release of the UA BBHM this labelling was kept, but for this new UA BBHM release it has been removed. Thus, for a user who has downloaded UA BBHM files for any of the capital cities from the previous release, the files are named as for the example of Vienna (WIEN) in Figure 5‑2. As can be seen from the example, this was the second FUA version of Vienna, indicated by the “L2”. For this new release the downloaded folder names will not have this LX, where X indicates a number, see Figure 5‑3.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑2 Example of naming of previous releases’ .zip-file\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑3 Example of naming of current releases\n\n\nRegarding versioning there are a few aspects to take into consideration:\nIn the first release there were two versions: version “v010” (original version) and version “v020” if the city had been re-mapped due to some area extension, see Figure 5‑4. There were six cities with version “v020”. In this new release these cities will display version “v030”.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑4 Example of cities with areas extension, and the subsequent version ”v020”\n\n\nThe remaining 25 capital cities that were a part of the previous release have not been updated for building height values but were subjected to a remapping of “0” values into “NoData”, to be aligned with this new release. In this case these cities will display version “v020”.\nAll newly added cities for this release will display version “v010”.\n\n\n5.2.2 Dataset\nIn this folder, a raster file in GeoTIFF format is stored. This is a layer that shows the heights of the buildings, with a data type of 16-bit unsigned integer (UInt16) with LZW compression, since a negative height value on buildings is not expected. It presents a MMU of 10 x 10 meters, and it is projected to the European terrestrial reference system “ETRS89 Lambert Azimuthal Equal Area (LAEA)” with EPSG:3035. All information that does not correspond to a building height value is classified as NoData, with a value in the data matrix of 65535. These characteristics allow the GeoTIFF file to occupy a very small size (as compared to the first release that also included “0” values). It was decided to remove the zeros because we could not distinguish a “0” that was a measured value or a “0” that referred to vegetation, water or roads (masked out).\nWhen the user opens the GeoTIFF file in a GIS software, it will be displayed using a default grayscale ramp, as the product does not have a default color ramp or style defined.\n\n\n5.2.3 Metadata\nA metadata file is created for each BBHM file, containing the information of the product. The information refers to data identification, classification of spatial data, geographic reference, temporal reference, quality and validity, conformity, constraints related to access and use and responsible organisation. These files were created according to the EEA metadata INSPIRE compliant requirements guideline.\n\n\n5.2.4 Pixel Based Information\nThe Pixel Based information data includes an ESRI shapefile layer, together with its associated files, showing the information and spatial distribution of the VHR satellite, or LiDAR, image pairs used for the construction of the Digital Height Model (DHM).\nEach file details the images conforming each false stereo pair. The information is subdivided into polygonal entities. When one of the polygonal entities is selected the accompanying attribute table can be shown, see example in Figure 5‑5. The attribute table shows the properties of the images that compose the image pair used to evaluate the building height in that specific area; like the image ID, the date of image acquisition, sensor used (vehicle, see Table 5‑2), percentage of cloud cover, the value of nadir angle, sun elevation, and value of azimuthal angle. These values are essential for the calculation of the DSM using optical satellite photogrammetry technology, see chapter 6.3.\n\n\n\nFigure 5‑5 Shapefile attribute table with the main characteristics of sensor images used\n\n\nThe previous example is true for any of the 845 new cities added or capital cities remapped in this release, i.e. the 25 capital cities which were not remapped from the previous release will not have a folder called Pixel Based Info in the downloaded .zip-file. These 25 capital cities from the previous release have been included without remapping, however they have undergone a reprocessing as described in chapter 6.6.\nTable 5‑2 shows the name and description of the different sensors used.\n\nTable 5‑2 List of sensors used\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSensor\nDescription\nResolution\nSpectral Bands\n\n\n\n\nWV-01\nWorldview 1\n0.5\nPAN\n\n\nWV-02\nWorldview 2\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nWV-03\nWorldview 3\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nGE-01\nGeoEye 01\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nQB-02\nQuickbird 02\n0.65\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\nIK\nIkonos\n0.5\nPAN + RGB NIR\n\n\n\n\n\n5.2.5 QC\nThe QC report is a report in PDF format with the results obtained after the execution of the quality control.

    "section": "6.1 Defining and refining the AoIs",
    "text": "6.1 Defining and refining the AoIs\nThe AoI (Area of Interest) for the BBHM represents the urban areas of each city or urban centre. It is the combination of Urban Audit cities from 20181 and urban centres from 20112 (also called high-density clusters) available at GISCO3 servers.\nThe two files were merged and added to the high-density clusters of West Balkans and Turkey delineated in the framework of a previous project since West Balkans and Turkey are not part of GISCO. It represents approximately an area of 198.000km². For simplicity reasons it was decided to call it the City Perimeter described in more detail in 6.1.1.\nThis initial AoI had to be refined. The process of refining the initial AoI is described below and illustrated in Figure 6‑2.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑2 Flowchart of the AoI refinement process\n\n\n\n6.1.1 City Perimeter (City + High density clusters polygon)\nThe City Perimeter is the outer delineation of the merging of the Urban Audit cities for 2018 and “high-density clusters” (also called “urban centres”) for 2011.\nAll these files originate from different dates but were the best available at the time. The Urban Audit cities are from 2018, the High Density Custers from 2011, while the UA underlying LC/LU data is from 2012 and the satellite information are based on 2012 data, or as close as possible to 2012, see further in chapter 6.2.1.\nThis AoI was used during the searching of satellite images for the DSMs generation.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑3 Left: City administrative area (purple) and high density cluster (black line inside purple field) of Leuven. Right: City administrative area and high-density cluster merged into City Perimeter layer\n\n\n\n\n6.1.2 UA Urban Areas Classes\nThe second step in refining the AoI for the BBHM product is to select the relevant LC/LU classes from Urban Atlas where buildings are expected to be found, i.e., any classes belonging to codes 1XXXX, but not for example forests or pastures or any of the classes with codes 2XXXX-5XXXX. For reference, the nomenclature of Urban Atlas LC/LU product can be found in pages 19-21 of the Nomenclature guideline4.\nThe selected classes from the Urban Atlas representing urban areas can be seen below:\n\nAirports\nDiscontinuous dense urban fabric (S.L.: 50% - 80%)\nDiscontinuous low density urban fabric (S.L.: 10% - 30%)\nDiscontinuous medium density urban fabric (S.L.: 30% - 50%)\nDiscontinuous very low density urban fabric (S.L.: &lt; 10%)\nContinuous urban fabric (S.L.: &gt; 80%)\nIsolated structures\nIndustrial, commercial, public, military and private units\nPort areas\nGreen urban areas\nRailways\nSports and leisure facilities\n\nThis AoI (UA Urban Areas Classes) is used to clip the City Perimeter AoI, to represents areas where buildings are expected within the defined City Perimeter AoI.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑4 Comparison between City Perimeter (purple) and UA Urban Areas Classes layer (red)\n\n\nA buffer of 50 m is added around the borders to avoid border errors, see Figure 6‑5.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑5 Selected UA Urban Areas classes, city of Leuven (Belgium). Left: Final result of selected classes. Right: Example of a buffer area applied to expand the original margin.\n\n\nThe result is the UA Urban Areas classes + 50 m mapped within the City Perimeter boundaries. The polygons within this shapefile are then checked for small gaps, which are filled.\nWhenever UA LC/LU classes were missing within the City Perimeter of a selected city, these missing polygons were manually created and added. In some cases, the same UA Urban Areas classes were included in two separate cities. Depending on factors like distance between the cities, FUA codes and city codes in UA, these cities have either been considered one and the same (when close together for example) or separate cities (for example when there is a big distance between them, or the cities have different city codes in the UA).\nThe previous release of the BBHM included 38 European capital cities. These areas have not been remapped in this release, except for in cases where new areas have been added to the city’s FUA (a total of 13).\nThe total number of cities mapped in this release of the BBHM is 845.\n\n\n6.1.3 UA roads, water, and wetland\nAn additional shapefile extracted from UA is created including the UA classes of: Other roads and associated land, Water or Wetlands, see Figure 6‑6. This layer is useful to eliminate pixels that do not represent buildings.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑6 Urban roads, city of Leuven (Belgium). Left: Land uses (orange), UA Urban Areas Classes. Right: Example of class selection. (red).\n\n\nThe following example shows the different AoIs applied for the city of Münster, located in the west of Germany. Figure 6‑6 shows the three types of AoIs used in the refinement process Anything in the City Perimeter AoI which does not correspond to buildings is shown in red (will be given the value NoData in the final dataset); the UA Urban Areas Classes AoI are shown in orange (numerical values in dataset if building is present), and the UA roads, water, and wetland AoI is shown in pink.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑7 Examples of the AoIs for Münster, Germany. NoData (red), UA Urban Areas Classes (orange) and Urban Road (pink)\n\n\n\n\n6.1.4 Building Footprints\nBuilding Footprints represent the individual constructions that were present in 2012 within the Urban Atlas. The Building Footprints layer is obtained by applying an elaborated Python algorithm to the selected high resolution satellite images, which leverages a semantic segmentation model to extract and separate individual buildings in densely compacted areas. The algorithm considers the pixel information of the multispectral and panchromatic images.\nConvolutional neural networks (CNN) architecture is used for semantic segmentation of building footprints from multispectral images, and to label every pixel in the images. After each convolution layer an extra batch normalization layer will be added to avoid any extreme values, reducing sensitivity towards initial weights and reduce overfitting of the model.\nBasic morphological operation on binary data will be used for noise removal. Thereafter a Local Maxima approach will be used to separate connected buildings, by allocating local maxima and higher weight to the larger area out of building and connection. The Local Maxima is used as input source/sink in a watershed algorithm used for image segmentation. Each building obtained from this process is given a unique index for further processing. The result is a raster.\nFor areas with dense vegetation, the algorithm might generate some confusing pixels. Therefore, a review of the Building Footprints layer has been carried out for areas with dense vegetation. Hereafter a quality control is conducted to verify that no buildings or constructions were excluded, and to discard false positives.\nThe raster is then vectorized. Spatial references and coordinate systems are preserved at every step and are transferred to vector file for correct overlaying. While converting from raster to vector, the output has a lot of vertices and noises. The vector is then simplified using Douglas-Peucker algorithm (David Douglas, 1973) to help preserve the overall geometry of the shape while simplifying number of vertices. Basic attributes like area, perimeter and elevation of the buildings were automatically added. Finally, minimum bounding box was used and saved.\nThe resulting Building Footprints was later used in the BBHM production as a mask to separate areas with height data values from areas with no height data values, see chapter 6.6. If there is building footprints data available in the area, this will be considered for refining the AoI of each city.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑8 Building footprints for the city of Leuven (Belgium)"

    "section": "6.2 Data pre-processing",
    "text": "6.2 Data pre-processing\nThe main input data is comprised of VHR satellite images from 2012, on which the different algorithms for producing the DSM and DTM will be executed, see chapter 6.3 and 6.4. The different sensors used for the VHR image collection are, as shown in Table 5‑2, Worldview 1, 2, 3, Quickbird, Ikonos and Geoeye. The aim is to acquire stereoscopic pair images, overlapping imagery acquired from different locations, to produce a 3D model for the refined AoIs.\nThe worldwide coverage of stereoscopic pair images is very limited, as it is not the most common and easy data to capture. Satellite data might therefore, despite the vast number of images, not be sufficient to create stereo pair images of all the refined AoIs in the mapped FUAs. Instead, false stereo pair images can be used. False stereo pair images make use of two images taken from different angles, and/or not on the same date or in a simultaneous capture. The images that form the false stereo pair should however be taken as close as possible to each other in time to improve the correlation between them, which increases precision. This approach guarantees coverage of all the refined AoIs with images from different dates. To create false stereo pairs the VHR satellite images from MAXAR products are supported with Copernicus satellite images through Copernicus Reference Access Data (CORDA), and as a further option LiDAR information.\nIn cases where no satellite image close to year 2012 is available, and also no images from CORDA, the search date range is expanded, primarily around 2012 (Q4 for 2011 or Q1 for 2013) and secondarily for later years (2014 onwards) as later years have more available satellites (WV3 etc.) from which data imagery can be gathered.\nThe process of selecting suitable VHR, CORDA and LiDAR imagery was based on the following key factors:\n\nImagery availability from the MAXAR Catalogue, CORDA\nDate of capture, see detailed description in chapter 6.2.1\nOff-Nadir Angle and Cloud Cover, see detailed description in chapter 6.2.2\n\n\n6.2.1 Date of capture\nThe following are the relevant scenarios for fulfilling the “Date of capture”-criteria for the selection of VHR and LiDAR images:\n\nScenario 1: The best option for selection of images is the use of LiDAR information from dates as close as possible to 2012, when available. This scenario shows better results since there is more density and precision.\nScenario 2: The second best option is images from 2012 taken in the same month and in the same day. Part of the area has been reviewed and is covered with images from 2012. Where images are not available, LiDAR information from 2012, or on a date as close as possible to 2012, will be prioritized for generating the BBHM.\nScenario 3: The third best option is to use images from 2012 captured in the same month but on different days.\nScenario 4: The fourth best option is using images from second half of 2011 or first half of 2013 in the same month and in the same day.\nScenario 5: The fifth best option is images from 2012 with a difference in date of capture of approximately 1 month.\nScenario 6: Scenario 2 but in the first part of 2011 or in the second part of 2013\nScenario 7 (extra): Images from 2014, 2015 and 2016… until today of similar dates (i.e. captured on the same day or week). It has been shown that images of the same season and similar date give good results for obtaining elevation models even though the dates differ by one year. The only thing that would affect this scenario is in terms of large changes in apples that were not in one of the years being analyzed. In this scenario, an analysis of change between the two dates will be made. Thanks to the refinement of the AoI the commission and omission error will be minimized because the Refined AoI is focused on the Urban Areas.\n\nThe images are selected and downloaded from the MAXAR library and organized in pairs of images for each city. The images are separated by CAT IDs, which is a unique code for each image. Images were then quality controlled for errors, reviewed and validated for use, as well as merged to ease the further processing of the images. This phase generates as a result a list of selected images to be used in the next analysis, where the algorithms for creating the DSM and DTM are applied.\n\n\n6.2.2 Off-Nadir Angle and Cloud Cover\nThe most suitable satellite images were selected, in the case of Off-Nadir angle, based on base-to-height ratio, Convergence, BIE and Asymmetry Angle. If these values, when estimated, are not in the correct range, the DSMs are not correctly built.\n\n6.2.2.1 Off-Nadir Angle\nThe best is to have images with an Off-Nadir angle of 20 degrees. Pairs formed with images that have less than 5 degrees or more than 45 degrees Off-Nadir angle give bad results, and are discarded. As far as possible, images with Off-Nadir angles of more than 40 degrees have been avoided. From these criteria two scenarios are made:\n\nScenario 1: Pair of satellite images with Off-Nadir angles of between 10 and 20 degrees\nScenario 2: Satellite images with Off-Nadir angles of between 5 and 30 degrees, preferably between 5 and 20 degrees\n\nFor urban areas, large angles of convergence would lead to ground occlusions, as well as a loss of similarity between the two images that form the “stereo pair” and, consequently, a worsening of the process of searching for homologous points by automatic correlation (matching). For these reasons, small Base/Height (B/H) ratios are preferred in urban areas (Eckert and Hollands, 2010). Using an algorithm that considers the maximum and minimum incidence angle, the time difference of the images, the angle between the two images and the region of interest, a Pearson’s correlation matrix and a B/H coefficient as a function of the orbital geometric parameters of the image, as well as temporal parameters are obtained, thanks to which it is possible to find which “false stereo pair” image is the most suitable to use in the generation of the DSM, see chapter 6.3.\n\nThe selected false stereo pair images have an angle difference of 20 degrees and none of them beyond 35 degrees.\n\n\n6.2.2.2 Cloud cover\nThe aim is to generate cloud-free results, for this reason all scenes were selected, regardless of cloud cover. This approach maximized the results, facilitating the selection of the best scenarios. In case some scattered cloudiness was found in an image, a proprietary cloud masking algorithm based on multilayer neural networks was applied. If clouds covered buildings in an image, this image was discarded. In case some scattered cloudiness could be found, a proprietary cloud masking algorithm based on multilayer neural networks was applied."

    "text": "6.3 Generating the DSM\nBased on the (false) stereo pair images, a digital surface model (DSM) is generated, which represents the height of all objects above the earth’s surface, i.e. plant/forest canopy or the top of artificial constructions such as buildings.\nThe major steps in creating the DSM are:\n\nSelection of suitable (false) stereo pair images\nPixel-wise stereo correspondence\nVoid filling\nAutomated outlier detection and removal\n3D point cloud creation, including RPC improvement\nProjection, alignment and homogenisation of the 3D point cloud\nProcess QA\n\nThe avaiable false stereo pair images for a certain AoI, obtained through the process described in chapter 6.2, are further processed to generate the DSM. The method for generating the DSM is based on taking elevations from the terrain using the false stereo pair satellite images, and by choosing the most suitable false stereo pair images. The images chosen are panchromatic with high spatial resolution of 30, 40 or 50 cm, and RPC information.\nThereafter a stereo correspondence between the two chosen images that make up each false stereo image pair is conducted, using a patented-modified version of the Semi-Global Matching (SGM) algorithm. The algorithm is based on global energy minimization that comprises a cost of equalization in pixels and smoothness terms in disparity mapping. The algorithm then applies a 3-kernel median filter to fill in small holes in null match points in the disparity map. By implementing a version of the classic RANdom SAmple Consensus (RANSAC) based on reverse methodology, outliers are eliminated.\nLastly, a 3D point cloud is obtained by triangulating the stereo correspondences between the two panchromatic VHR images, taking into consideration the rational polynomial coefficients (RPC) camera model provided for each image. The RCPs will allow triangulating the position of a 3D point identified on an image pair. This elaboration of the Digital Surface Models (DSM) is carried out using an AI-EOSURFACE algorithm on Python and C++ (and compatible with C heads) based on the epipolar geometry of a given pair of satellite images, see Figure 6‑9.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑9 Schematic representation of the epipolar geometry for a given pair of satellite images, on which the AI-EOSURFACE algorithm is based to obtain elevations\n\n\nThis algorithm has been developed for the DSM generation based on the bidimensional couple of points of a pair for the later three-dimensional densification. The dataset includes images from different platforms, all of them with a spatial resolution of 0.5 m. The DSM generation only requires the panchromatic band, however RGB and NIR bands were included as these are required for other processes of the BBHM creation.\nThe independently calculated 3D point cloud is then projected, aligned and homogenized, and the DSM is generated with a spatial resolution of 50 cm, and all DSMs are transformed to an orthometric height because to transform height data into meters of above sea level."

    "section": "6.4 Generating the DTM",
    "text": "6.4 Generating the DTM\nDigital terrain models (DTMs) represent the height of the bare earth’s surface. In this case, the DTMs are generated from the DSM. Non-ground features such as buildings, trees, bushes and vehicles have to be identified, and their height measurements removed from the data before interpolation. Once the DSM has been generated, it is filtered using a building emptying algorithm and removing objects that are not bare ground. Thereafter a pixel level prediction and clustering approach is used on a high-resolution multispectral image to detect the bare terrain.\nThe DTM is carried out using an AI-EOTERRAIN algorithm on Python to process each row of the given DSM separately in all directions in a window with a given extent, considering the minimum value of each row as the position of the ground. Therefore, if the pixel being evaluated has a large difference with the minimum value, the pixel is considered as not corresponding to ground, as well as when the slope between the evaluated pixel and the next one is positive and above a predefined threshold. If the slope is positive but less than the threshold, the evaluated pixel gets the same label as the pixel evaluated in the previous iteration. If the slope is less or equal, the distance to the nearest ground point is used to decide whether the evaluated pixel is classified as ground or not.\nThe building extraction process was successful with most buildings, however, in buildings that occupy a large area, the algorithm interprets the innermost areas of the roofs as ground values, due to the homogeneity of the slopes. To ensure that all values of the emptied DSM correspond to ground values, a second filtering is done using the buildings footprints layers, see chapter 6.1.4.\nDSM algorithm | Building footprints | DSM filtered\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑10 DSM filtering to remove large buildings and obtain the DTM\n\n\nThereafter the remaining bare ground is filtered by a cut off range for objects to remain in the DTM. This is based on the gradient difference, the size of the object to be removed and the terrain type, this can be either flat or hilly. A “bump and pit”-filter is applied to smoothe the DTM by removing small pits and bumps in the landscape; a median filter which is part of the final smoothing of the DTM; and finally the clamp filter, which stabilizes portions of the elevation model by raising and lowering pixels within a defined threshold.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑11 Left: DSM for an area in London.

    "text": "6.6 Generating the BBHM\nOnce the DHM of the city is available, it is necessary to extract only the height values that correspond to buildings. To do this, first all the buildings are detected from the available multispectral VHR images, using machine learning techniques. Then a building footprint extraction operation is performed, obtaining a GeoTIFF raster layer with the height values of the buildings, and with a NoData value for all those elements which are not buildings.\nTo extract the values that correspond to buildings, the vector files of the building footprints and the DHM files are required as input.\nSince the building footprints layer are in vector format with complex geometries, these are transformed into Boolean raster format, where the pixels with zero values represent the areas that do not include buildings.\nOnce the DHM file and its associated building footprints file are both available in raster format and with the same extension, a multiplication is performed, resulting in a DHM with height values only in the areas occupied by buildings. Finally, all pixels with zero in height value, i.e. the height assigned to all elements other than buildings, are reclassified to a NoData value, as otherwise they could have a negative influence on subsequent processes. This is an important difference to note between the 2006 and 2012 edition of the BBHM. It was introduced in this release since in the previous release it was not possible to distinguish between satellite measured zero values, and zero values assigned because of the type of area. Instead, in this release, all areas not representing buildings have a NoData value.\nFinally, the DHM has undergone resampling through a number of filters; reprojection to EPSG3035 coordinate system, removal of pixels outside of the City Perimeter AoI, removal of pixels outside of the UA Urban Areas AoI, removal of pixels within the Urban roads AoI and finally resampling from a resolution of 0.5m to a resolution of 10 m using a majority filter.\nThis point explains why it is necessary to translate the 0 height data values of the input DHM to NoData, since otherwise the majority of values in a pixel corresponding to a building could be equal to 0 due to the influence of the surrounding street.\nIt is also important to point out the role played by vegetation in this process, since, as the DSM is derived from stereoscopic images; it is possible that trees near buildings influence the final value of certain pixels.\nAlso, a reclassification of all pixels with a value lower than 3 m is performed, since it is assumed that no buildings are lower than 3 m.\nFinally, a final conversion of the DHM files is executed to adapt them to the requirements set according to CLMS Tools needs.\n\nEPSG:3035 coordinate reference system\nGeoTIFF data type UInt16.\nNo data value equal to 65535.\nCompression type LZW\nPixel size 10 m\nBLOCKSIZE 256x256 Specification\nTILED = YES\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑13 From a general DHM (left) to a BBHM (right) in Münster, Germany\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑14 Final BBHM at 10x10 meter resolution for Münster, Germany\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑15 General overview of building height values on Milano and zoom to the city center"

    "section": "6.7 Characteristics and limitations of the product",
    "text": "6.7 Characteristics and limitations of the product\nThis chapter describes the properties of the product and some methodological aspects that are important to understand the characteristics and limitations of the product.\nIt is important to note that because the DSMs are derived from LiDAR and VHR satellite information, the initially generated DHMs have a spatial resolution of between 0.5 and 2 meters. For the final product to comply with EEA technical requirements (spatial resolution of 10 meters), a resampling operation was performed to transform the DHM pixels from 0.5-2 m to 10 m.\nFor this transformation to be consistent with the first height values obtained, it was agreed to use a majority algorithm, i.e. the calculation will determine the most common value shown by the 0.5 - 2 m pixels contained within a new 10 m pixel, which will be assigned the most repeated value after the execution of this analysis.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑16 Methodological explanation about how the majority filter works when resampling\n\n\nIt is this simple resampling operation that poses the main limitations of the BBHM Urban Atlas product, which are further detailed below.\n\nNo height values in buildings that are smaller that the minimum mapping size\n\nDue to the spatial resolution of the pixel, there will be a NoData value in buildings smaller than 100 m2, such as single-family houses, buildings for public use etc., see example in Figure 6‑17.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑17 Small houses that have not been captured in the BBHM due to the minimum mapping size\n\n\n\nIssues on building edges\n\nThe influence of height values of elements or artifacts adjacent to the buildings can induce abnormally high or low values in the pixels of the edges of the buildings. In case of influence of the ground abnormally low values would be presented, or abnormally high values if it is a tree or other vertical element that interferes.\nThis happens, in addition to the majority algorithm, when extracting the height values within the building footprints. This is because it is very unusual that the outline of the building represented in the DHM coincides exactly with its building footprint, which causes the edge pixels to be retained in the DHM prior to the resampling process and, therefore, may interfere with the final result.\nThe example in Figure 6‑18 shows the height values obtained for a random building, in this case obtained by means of LIDAR technology, with a spatial resolution of 2 m.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑18 Satellite imagery (left) and DSM at half meter resolution (right)\n\n\nFigure 6‑19 shows how some pixels, with ground elevation information, are represented in red tones after extraction of the DHM values in relation to the building footprints.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑19 Difference between DSM at half meter resolution and final BBHM (right)\n\n\nWhen the resampling operation is performed and the final result is obtained, this ground elevation information is transferred to the pixels that make up the building boundary, causing the aforementioned alterations in the value of these pixels.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑20 Overview of building edges in the BBHM\n\n\nWithout a detailed case-by-case study it is not possible to conclude wheter these height deviations are caused by elements of the building itself or by influences from the ground or other artifacts. Thus, these pixels have not been corrected beyond those clearly identified during QC, which is the main limitation of the project.\nThe influence of edge elements becomes more noticeable in cities whose DHM values have been calculated from a DSM derived from VHR satellite imagery. This is because optical satellite photogrammetry technology does not reach the same levels of accuracy as achieved by LIDAR, and its results depend heavily on the acquisition properties of the images. Especially important are the angles and the correlation calculated between the two images, giving the results a more continuous and smooth appearance, i.e. there is no perfect detection of abrupt elevation changes intrinsic to the height difference between a building and the ground.\nThis behavior is especially noticeable in cities with a high density of buildings, close together, separated by narrow streets, typical in urban centers of historic cities. This combined with the resampling algorithm can result in areas with apparently great variability of building heights. This phenomenon can be observed in Figure 6‑21.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑21 Higher heterogeneity in BBHM dataset (right) than in a half meter resolution BBHM (bottom left)\n\n\n\nRoof artifacts\n\nAnother limitation of the product lies in the poor response to the LIDAR pulses of some roofs, especially noticeable in the metal cladding that covers some industrial buildings. These errors do not occur when using satellite photogrammetry and thus do not pose an issue in most of the processed cities. To correct the errors, the erroneous pixels are manually reclassified with the correct elevation value.\n\nLimitation of building footprints detection in scattered areas\n\nThe building footprints identification algorithm based on Machine Learning techniques has certain limitations when detecting isolated buildings, especially in rural environments, since the algorithm considers certain properties of coherence and spatial context for the identification of buildings. In the same way, the algorithm may present commission errors, which have been eliminated whenever they have been detected during QC.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑22 Limitations on building footprint detection especially; comission and omission\n\n\n\nUrban Areas with no values outside the AoI\n\nAs stated previously in the document, building height values are only gathered inside the AoI (see definition in chapter 6.1). In some cases, it is not possible to produce building height data for the entire delineation of the AoI, i.e. when part of the defined high-density cluster delineation falls outside the area that has been mapped by Urban Atlas. For example, the AoI for Malinas is a high-density cluster but is not mapped by Urban Atlas and does not have a FUA (no Urban Classes). Thus, it is key to consider that in these cases some urban areas in the city surroundings are not captured, so there is no height value.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑23 General view of Malinas, capturing industrial areas with no height values outside the AoI\n\n\n\n\n\nLimitations of DSM generation\n\nDSM generation from false pair stereo of satellite images is always challenging, since it depends on several variables: off-nadir angle, difference in days between images, cloud cover, etc. These values vary from city to city, but in general terms these have been the main issues:\n\nDSM orthorectification\nBuilding shadows\nSmall houses’ height\nOutlier removal\nWater-topography influence\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑24 Examples of the limitations of the DSM production\n\n\n\nLimitations on DTM generation\n\nWhen generating a DTM from DSM, the reliability on the accuracy of the DSM falls, e.g. a DSM derived from a high-density point cloud by using LiDAR information is more reliable than one built from satellite imagery. Also, an automatic algorithm pursues a constant accuracy across different realities, setting parameters to fix values that better capture all. However, larger buildings (e.g. industrial buildings) may not be removed completely, so a manual editing has been carried out in all the cities.\n\n\n\nFigure 6‑25 Example of DTM refinement"
